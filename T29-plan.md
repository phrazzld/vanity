# T29: Evaluate State Management Options

## Task Description

Assess state management needs and select an appropriate solution for the Vanity project.

## Classification

**Simple** - This task involves researching and evaluating state management solutions, then making a recommendation based on the project's needs.

## Current State Analysis

Looking at the current codebase:

- The project uses React hooks for local state management (useState, useContext)
- There are several custom hooks like useListState, useQuotesList, and useReadingsList
- The project has ThemeContext for dark/light mode switching
- There doesn't appear to be a global state management solution in place yet

## Evaluation Criteria

To select an appropriate state management solution, we should consider:

1. **Complexity** - Is the solution appropriate for the size and needs of the application?
2. **Learning Curve** - How easy is it to learn and implement?
3. **Performance** - How does it perform with the expected data volume and update frequency?
4. **Developer Experience** - Tooling, debugging capabilities, and integration with existing code
5. **Community Support** - Maturity, documentation, and long-term maintenance
6. **Bundle Size** - Impact on application size
7. **TypeScript Support** - Quality of type definitions and integration

## Options to Evaluate

Based on the development philosophy which recommends Zustand or Redux Toolkit for complex applications, and considering current React best practices:

1. **Context API + useReducer** (Built-in React)

   - Pros: No additional dependencies, simple for medium complexity
   - Cons: Can lead to re-render issues without careful optimization

2. **Zustand**

   - Pros: Simple API, minimal boilerplate, good performance
   - Cons: Less established than Redux

3. **Redux Toolkit**

   - Pros: Well-established, extensive ecosystem, great dev tools
   - Cons: More boilerplate, steeper learning curve

4. **Jotai**

   - Pros: Atomic approach, minimal API, good for component-specific state
   - Cons: Newer library, smaller community

5. **TanStack Query (React Query) with minimal global state**
   - Pros: Excellent for server state, caching, and data fetching
   - Cons: Not designed for client-only state (would need to be paired with another solution)

## Implementation Plan

1. Review existing state patterns in the codebase
2. Analyze application state requirements
3. Evaluate each option against the criteria
4. Document findings and recommendations
5. Specify implementation approach for T30
