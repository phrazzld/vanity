### [CRITICAL TEST GAP] Fix Zustand Theme Store Test Isolation

**File**: src/store/**tests**/ui.test.ts:94
**Perspectives**: maintainability-maven, complexity-archaeologist
**Impact**: 13 of 14 theme tests skipped due to state bleeding between tests. Core theme functionality has ZERO effective test coverage (150+ lines untested)
**Risk**: Race conditions, localStorage bugs, media query issues won't be caught until production
**Fix**:

1. Isolate Zustand store between tests using `create` factory pattern
2. Reset store state in `beforeEach` hook
3. Re-enable all 13 skipped tests
4. Verify test isolation with `npm test -- ui.test.ts`
   **Effort**: M (4-6h) | **Value**: CRITICAL - Unblocks testing of core functionality
   **Acceptance**: All 13 tests enabled and passing with proper state isolation
