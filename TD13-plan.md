# TD13 Plan: Update Obsolete Snapshot Files

## Overview

This task involves updating or regenerating the obsolete snapshot files for the DarkModeToggle and SearchBar components. Snapshots become obsolete when component implementations change, and the snapshot tests help ensure that these changes are intentional rather than accidental.

## Current Status

The following snapshot files are marked as obsolete:

- `src/app/components/__tests__/__snapshots__/DarkModeToggle.snapshot.test.tsx.snap`
- `src/app/components/__tests__/__snapshots__/SearchBar.snapshot.test.tsx.snap`

This typically happens when component implementation changes but the snapshots haven't been updated to match. Since we have already verified the new implementations work correctly, we need to update the snapshots.

## Implementation Approach

1. **Verify Component Implementations**: First, examine the current implementations of the DarkModeToggle and SearchBar components to understand the changes that caused snapshots to become obsolete.

2. **Update Snapshots**: Use the Jest snapshot update flag to regenerate the snapshots based on the current component implementations.

3. **Verify Snapshot Tests**: Run the snapshot tests again to ensure they now pass with the updated snapshots.

4. **Document Changes**: Update the TODO.md file to mark this task as completed and add relevant notes.

## Specific Steps

1. Run `npm test -- -u` to update all obsolete snapshots.

2. Verify the updates by examining the updated snapshot files to ensure they reflect the expected changes.

3. Run `npm test -- src/app/components/__tests__/DarkModeToggle.snapshot.test.tsx src/app/components/__tests__/SearchBar.snapshot.test.tsx` to ensure the tests now pass with the updated snapshots.

4. Mark the task as completed in TODO.md.
