# CI Failure Summary

## Build Information

- **Workflow Run ID**: 15123905101
- **Branch**: plan/infrastructure-ci-cd
- **PR**: #22
- **Triggered**: via pull_request
- **Status**: FAILED
- **Failed Step**: Build Storybook

## Error Details

### Current Status

We successfully fixed the TypeScript errors in `src/lib/__tests__/logger.test.ts`, but new TypeScript errors are now visible in other test files during the Storybook build process.

### Remaining Errors

The Storybook build is now failing due to TypeScript errors in test files related to components:

1. Unused imports warning:

   ```
   TS6133: 'ThemeProvider' is declared but its value is never read.
   ```

2. Unused variables warnings:

   ```
   TS6133: 'src' is declared but its value is never read.
   TS6133: 'onError' is declared but its value is never read.
   ```

3. Type errors involving potentially undefined values:
   ```
   TS2345: Argument of type 'Element | undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Window | Document | Node | Element'.
   TS2322: Type 'Reading | undefined' is not assignable to type 'Reading'.
   ```

### Affected Files

Based on the error messages, the following files likely contain these issues:

1. `src/app/components/readings/__tests__/ReadingsList.test.tsx`
2. `src/app/components/readings/__tests__/YearSection.test.tsx`

### Root Cause

The TypeScript compiler in strict mode is detecting:

1. Unused imports and variables (lint errors)
2. Potential undefined values in DOM element selections
3. Missing null/undefined checks for array accesses
4. Type mismatch where an array element that might be undefined is being used in a context that requires a non-nullable type

## Impact

- PR still cannot be merged
- CI pipeline remains blocked
- Storybook cannot be built

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining TypeScript errors in component test files
2. Add proper null/undefined checks for array access in tests
3. Add type assertions where appropriate
4. Use proper TypeScript syntax for potentially undefined values
5. Re-run CI to verify all fixes work
