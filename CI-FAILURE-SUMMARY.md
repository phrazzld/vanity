# CI Failure Summary

## Build Information

- **Workflow Run ID**: 15099477666
- **Branch**: plan/infrastructure-ci-cd
- **PR**: phrazzld/vanity#22
- **Triggered**: via pull_request
- **Status**: FAILED
- **Failed Job**: Build and Test
- **Failed Step**: Run tests with coverage

## Error Details

### Primary Error

Snapshot tests failed in CI environment:

- 21 snapshots failed from 2 test suites
- 13 failed tests out of 164 total tests

### Failed Test Suites

1. `src/app/components/__tests__/SearchBar.snapshot.test.tsx`
2. `src/app/components/__tests__/DarkModeToggle.snapshot.test.tsx`

### Root Cause

The CI environment is detecting snapshot mismatches. The error states:

> New snapshot was not written. The update flag must be explicitly passed to write a new snapshot.
> This is likely because this test is run in a continuous integration (CI) environment in which snapshots are not written by default.

### Specific Failed Tests

1. SearchBar Component Snapshots:

   - Basic Rendering tests (4 failures)
   - Button Variants tests (2 failures)
   - Responsive Behavior tests (2 failures)
   - Theme Variants tests (2 failures)

2. DarkModeToggle Component Snapshots:
   - Size Variants tests (3 failures)
   - Theme Variants tests (4 failures)
   - Custom Classes test (1 failure)
   - Accessibility tests (2 failures)

## Additional Context

- The CI environment does not allow automatic snapshot updates
- The snapshots were previously deleted as obsolete, but they appear to still be needed
- The local tests pass, but CI detects mismatches
- 10 linting warnings about unused variables in scripts and test files

## Impact

- Pull request cannot be merged
- CI pipeline blocked
- Tests are failing even though coverage requirements are met

## Next Steps

1. Investigate why snapshots are failing in CI but not locally
2. Update snapshots appropriately
3. Ensure snapshot files are properly committed
4. Verify CI environment matches local development environment
