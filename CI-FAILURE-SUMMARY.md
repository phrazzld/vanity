# CI Failure Summary

## Build Information

- **Workflow Run ID**: 15118138987
- **Branch**: plan/infrastructure-ci-cd
- **PR**: #22
- **Triggered**: via pull_request
- **Status**: FAILED
- **Failed Step**: Build Storybook

## Error Details

### Primary Error

Storybook build is failing due to TypeScript errors in the `src/lib/__tests__/logger.test.ts` file.

```
TS2532: Object is possibly 'undefined'.
```

The errors are occurring in multiple places where mock function calls are accessed:

1. `consoleMocks.info.mock.calls[0][0]`
2. `consoleMocks.error.mock.calls[0][0]`
3. `consoleMocks.warn.mock.calls[0][0]`
4. `consoleMocks.warn.mock.calls[0][1]`

Additionally, there's a TypeScript error with assigning to `process.env.NODE_ENV`.

### Root Cause

The TypeScript compiler in strict mode is detecting that properties of the mock objects might be undefined, which could cause runtime errors. This issue specifically affects the Storybook build which seems to be using a stricter TypeScript configuration than the main Jest tests.

### Specific Failed Tests

The errors are in the logger tests at `src/lib/__tests__/logger.test.ts`, specifically:

1. Environment setup code:

   ```typescript
   process.env.NODE_ENV = originalEnv;
   ```

2. Mock access patterns:
   ```typescript
   const logOutput = consoleMocks.info.mock.calls[0][0] as string;
   const logOutput = consoleMocks.error.mock.calls[0][0] as string;
   const logOutput = consoleMocks.warn.mock.calls[0][0] as string;
   const logData = consoleMocks.warn.mock.calls[0][1] as Record<string, unknown>;
   ```

## Additional Context

- The issue only appears during the Storybook build process
- These errors don't appear to fail the main test run
- The errors are specifically related to TypeScript's strict null checking

## Impact

- PR cannot be merged
- CI pipeline blocked
- Storybook cannot be built

## Next Steps

1. Fix TypeScript strict mode errors in logger tests
2. Add proper null/undefined checks before accessing mock call properties
3. Address issue with modifying `process.env.NODE_ENV` in tests
4. Re-run CI to verify the fix works
