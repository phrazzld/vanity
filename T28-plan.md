**T28:** Implement Responsive Design Utilities

## Description

Create utilities leveraging Tailwind's responsive modifiers with documentation to enhance the responsive design capabilities of the project.

## Classification

**Simple** - This task involves extending our existing Tailwind configuration and creating documentation.

## Current State

- We have an enhanced Tailwind configuration from T26
- We have a design token system from T27
- Tailwind naturally includes responsive modifiers (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:)
- We need explicit documentation and potentially custom utilities

## Implementation Plan

1. **Add Custom Container Queries Support**

   - Extend Tailwind configuration to add support for container queries

2. **Create Responsive Utility Classes**

   - Add responsive variants for specific utility needs
   - Add custom breakpoints if needed

3. **Implement Screen Reader Utilities**

   - Add utility classes for responsive accessibility needs

4. **Create Responsive Documentation**
   - Document the responsive utilities and how to use them
   - Add examples of responsive patterns

## Detailed Steps

1. Update tailwind.config.ts to add container queries plugin and any custom responsive utilities
2. Create a new file in the docs folder to document responsive design patterns and utilities
3. Add examples of responsive layouts and component adaptations
4. Update the design tokens documentation to reference responsive design capabilities
