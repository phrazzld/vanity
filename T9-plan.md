# T9: Configure Semantic Versioning

## Task Description

Configure semantic versioning for the project to automate version bumping based on commit messages and generate a CHANGELOG file.

## Approach

### Understanding Semantic Versioning

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) follows the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:

- MAJOR version increments for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version increments for backward-compatible new functionality
- PATCH version increments for backward-compatible bug fixes

This task will automate versioning based on conventional commit messages:

- `fix:` commits trigger PATCH bumps
- `feat:` commits trigger MINOR bumps
- `feat!:` or commits with `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the description trigger MAJOR bumps

### Implementation Plan

1. **Tool Selection**:

   - Use `standard-version` which combines version bumping and CHANGELOG generation
   - This tool is well-maintained and works with conventional commits

2. **Setup Steps**:

   - Install required packages: `standard-version`
   - Configure version bumping rules in package.json
   - Set up scripts for version bumping and release

3. **CHANGELOG Generation**:

   - Configure CHANGELOG format and content
   - Ensure the CHANGELOG provides meaningful release notes based on commit messages

4. **Integration with Existing Workflow**:
   - Add documentation in README
   - Create a release script that can be run manually or as part of CI

## Technical Implementation Details

1. Install `standard-version` package
2. Add version scripts to package.json
3. Configure release options
4. Add README documentation about the versioning process
5. Test the implementation with sample commits

## Considerations

- This implementation builds on the previously configured conventional commits
- The version management will be consistent with the development philosophy's approach to semantic versioning
- CHANGELOG generation will provide a clear history of changes for each release
