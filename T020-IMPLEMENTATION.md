# T020: Add Security Scan to Pre-Push Hook

## Implementation Details

This document outlines the implementation of Task T020 from TODO.md, which requires adding security scanning to the pre-push Git hook to catch security vulnerabilities before they enter the codebase.

### Overview

The implementation consists of the following components:

1. A standalone security scanning script (`.husky/pre-push-security`) that can be:

   - Run independently
   - Integrated with the existing pre-push hook
   - Called from other scripts

2. Integration with the existing pre-push hook that preserves all current functionality

3. Configuration options for different scanning modes:
   - Quick scan (default): Only checks for high and critical vulnerabilities
   - Full scan: Comprehensive vulnerability check
   - Bypass option for emergency pushes

### Implementation Files

- **`.husky/pre-push-security`**: The standalone security scanning script
- **Integration patch** for `.husky/pre-push`: Code to add to the existing pre-push hook

### Features

The security scanning functionality includes:

1. **Vulnerability Scanning**:

   - Builds and runs the audit-filter script
   - Checks for non-allowlisted high and critical vulnerabilities
   - Provides clear error messages and remediation guidance

2. **Secret Detection**:

   - Basic pattern matching for potential secrets
   - Interactive confirmation for detected patterns
   - Prevents accidental credential leakage

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Quick mode for faster feedback
   - Minimal rebuilding of scripts
   - Clear output and progress indicators

### Integration Instructions

To integrate the security scanning into the existing pre-push hook:

1. Add the following code to the end of `.husky/pre-push`:

```sh
# ========================================
# Security vulnerability scan
# ========================================
echo "üîí Running security vulnerability scan..."
if [ -f ".husky/pre-push-security" ]; then
  sh .husky/pre-push-security
else
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Security scan script not found. Skipping security checks."
fi
```

2. Make the security script executable:

```sh
chmod +x .husky/pre-push-security
```

3. Test the integration:

```sh
# Test with bypass to prevent actual pushing
SKIP_SECURITY_SCAN=true git push --dry-run
```

### Usage

**Normal Usage:**

```sh
git push
```

The security scan will run automatically as part of the pre-push checks.

**Bypass for Emergencies:**

```sh
SKIP_SECURITY_SCAN=true git push
```

**Force Quick or Full Scan:**

```sh
SECURITY_QUICK_MODE=false git push  # Full scan
SECURITY_FULL_SCAN=true git push    # Rebuild and full scan
```

### Next Steps

1. **Documentation Updates**:

   - Add usage instructions to CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Document bypass options and when to use them

2. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Add more sophisticated secret scanning
   - Integrate with third-party security tools
   - Improve performance through caching
