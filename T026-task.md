# T026: Streamline build verification

## Classification: Complex

## Original Ticket Text

**T026 · Chore · P3: Streamline build verification**

- **Action:**
  1. Remove redundant build verification steps
  2. Consolidate verification processes where possible
- **Done-when:**
  1. Build process is efficient with no redundancy
- **Depends-on:** none

## Implementation Approach Analysis

This task requires analyzing the current build verification pipeline to identify and eliminate redundancy while maintaining quality gates. The analysis must consider:

### Current State Analysis Required:

1. **package.json scripts** - Identify overlapping build/verification commands
2. **CI/CD pipeline** - Review GitHub Actions workflow for redundant steps
3. **Pre-commit hooks** - Check for duplicate validation processes
4. **Script files** - Examine verification scripts for consolidation opportunities

### Key Considerations:

1. **Quality Gate Preservation** - Must not compromise essential validation steps
2. **CI Pipeline Efficiency** - Reduce build time without sacrificing reliability
3. **Developer Experience** - Streamline local development workflow
4. **Tool Integration** - Leverage overlapping capabilities of different tools

### Risk Assessment:

- **High Risk**: Accidentally removing essential verification steps
- **Medium Risk**: Breaking CI pipeline or local development scripts
- **Low Risk**: Minor inefficiencies in script organization

### Architecture Alignment:

Following DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md principles:

- **Automate Everything**: Maintain comprehensive automation while eliminating redundancy
- **Quality Gates**: Preserve all mandatory CI stages per Section 3.2
- **Simplicity First**: Remove unnecessary complexity in build processes

### Success Criteria:

1. Reduced total build/verification time
2. No loss of quality assurance coverage
3. Simplified script organization
4. Maintained CI reliability
5. Clear documentation of changes made
