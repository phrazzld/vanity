# Security Vulnerability Baseline Report

## Overview

This document establishes the baseline security vulnerability status for the Vanity project dependencies as of `2025-05-20`. It serves as a reference point for tracking vulnerability management over time.

## Scan Methodology

- **Tool**: npm audit with custom allowlist filtering script
- **Threshold**: High and critical vulnerabilities
- **Command Used**: `npm audit --json`
- **Branch**: feature/security-scan-job
- **Date**: 2025-05-20

## Baseline Results

Our initial security scan shows:

| Severity Level | Count |
| -------------- | ----- |
| Critical       | 0     |
| High           | 0     |
| Moderate       | 0     |
| Low            | 0     |
| Total          | 0     |

### Detailed Findings

The current codebase has no detected vulnerabilities at any severity level. This provides a clean baseline from which to measure future security posture.

      "peerOptional": 0,
      "total": 1745
    }
  }
}
```

## Analysis

The project currently maintains a strong security posture with no detected vulnerabilities. This may be attributed to:

1. Regular dependency updates
2. Careful selection of dependencies
3. Recent project initialization with up-to-date packages

## Allowlist Status

The project has an allowlist mechanism in place (`.audit-allowlist.json`), but currently no entries are needed as there are no vulnerabilities to allowlist.

## Remediation Plan

No immediate remediation is required as there are no vulnerabilities to address.

## Recommendations

1. **Maintain Regular Audits**: Continue running security scans as part of the development workflow
2. **Monitor Dependencies**: Be vigilant when adding new dependencies
3. **Upgrade Strategy**: Keep dependencies updated regularly
4. **Allowlist Management**: Use the allowlist mechanism judiciously when vulnerabilities are identified

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring for new vulnerabilities
2. Verify that the security scan CI job correctly identifies new vulnerabilities when introduced
3. Review this baseline report quarterly or when significant changes occur to dependencies

## Conclusion

This baseline security vulnerability scan establishes that the project currently has no known high or critical vulnerabilities in its dependencies. This document will serve as a reference point for future vulnerability assessments and remediation efforts.
