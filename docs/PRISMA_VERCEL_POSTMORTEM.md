# Prisma Vercel Deployment Bug Postmortem

## Root Cause Summary

The application build was failing on Vercel with a `PrismaClientInitializationError`. This occurred because Vercel caches dependencies during the build process, which prevented Prisma from auto-generating its client. Without the generated client, any code that attempts to use Prisma (such as our API routes) fails during the build phase.

## Timeline of Debugging Steps

1. **Analysis of Error Message**
   - Identified that the error specifically mentioned Vercel's caching mechanism
   - Noted the error occurred during the collection of page data, specifically for the `/api/quotes` route
   - Confirmed the error was related to Prisma client initialization

2. **Package.json Script Review**
   - Examined our build script and found it was only running `next build`
   - Determined we needed to run `prisma generate` before building the application
   - The Prisma documentation link in the error message confirmed this approach

3. **Prisma Client Implementation Check**
   - Verified that our Prisma client singleton pattern in `src/lib/prisma.ts` was correct
   - Confirmed that API routes were properly importing and using the Prisma client

## Resolution

We updated the build script in `package.json` to include Prisma client generation before building the Next.js application:

```json
"build": "prisma generate && next build"
```

Additionally, we added a convenience script for manual Prisma client generation:

```json
"prisma:generate": "prisma generate"
```

This ensures that the Prisma client is always freshly generated before building the application, preventing issues with Vercel's dependency caching.

## Recommendations to Prevent Recurrence

1. **Documentation Update**
   - Add a section to the project README about deployment considerations, especially for database integration
   - Include a note about the importance of the `prisma generate` step in the build process

2. **Deployment Checklist**
   - Create a pre-deployment checklist that includes database-related steps
   - Ensure that ORM-specific build requirements are addressed before pushing to production

3. **CI/CD Improvements**
   - Consider adding a pre-build verification step that checks for necessary build configurations
   - Set up automated tests that simulate the production build environment to catch these issues earlier

4. **Knowledge Sharing**
   - Share this lesson with the team to ensure everyone understands the interaction between Prisma and deployment platforms
   - Document the specific requirements of different deployment environments (local, staging, production)
