# Security Scan Test Verification

This file documents the verification tests performed for the security scanning implementation.

## Test Cases

### T012: CI Pass Case - No New Vulnerabilities

This test verifies that the CI security scan correctly passes when no new vulnerabilities are present.

**Test Date:** 2025-05-20
**Branch:** feature/security-scan-job
**PR:** [#23](https://github.com/phrazzld/vanity/pull/23)
**Expected Outcome:** CI security scan job passes successfully

## Test Results

### T012 Results:

The security scan job successfully passed when no new vulnerabilities were present, confirming that:

1. The security scanning workflow is correctly integrated into the CI pipeline
2. The security scan does not produce false positives when no vulnerabilities exist
3. The workflow correctly processes the scan results

**CI Workflow:** [GitHub Actions Run #15150876392](https://github.com/phrazzld/vanity/actions/runs/15150876392)
**Security Scan Logs:**

```
ðŸ”’ Checking for non-allowlisted high and critical security vulnerabilities...
ðŸ”’ Running npm audit with allowlist filtering...
âœ… Security scan passed!
```

This verifies that the security scanning implementation correctly handles the case where no vulnerabilities are present, which is the expected default state for the repository.
