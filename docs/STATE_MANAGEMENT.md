# State Management Evaluation

This document evaluates different state management solutions for the Vanity project and provides recommendations based on the project's specific needs.

## Current State Management Approach

The codebase currently uses:

1. **React's Built-in State Management**
   - `useState` for simple component state
   - `useContext` with ThemeContext for dark/light mode preferences
   - `useReducer` with custom hooks for complex list state

2. **Custom State Hooks**
   - `useListState`: A generic hook for managing paginated, filterable, sortable lists using `useReducer`
   - `useQuotesList` and `useReadingsList`: Domain-specific hooks built on top of useListState

3. **API Data Fetching**
   - Custom fetch logic in hooks for quotes and readings data
   - No global caching or request deduplication

## State Management Requirements

Based on the codebase analysis, the project needs to handle:

1. **UI State**: Theme preferences, modal states, sidebar visibility
2. **List/Collection State**: Paginated data with sorting, filtering, and search
3. **Form State**: Input values, validation, submission status
4. **Authentication State**: User session, permissions
5. **Server Data**: Quotes, readings, and other data from APIs with caching

## Evaluation of Options

### 1. Context API + useReducer (Current Approach)

**Pros:**

- Already being used effectively for theme and list state
- No additional dependencies
- Strong TypeScript support
- Simple for medium complexity applications
- Follows React's recommended patterns

**Cons:**

- Context consumers re-render on any context value change
- Requires careful optimization for performance (memoization)
- No built-in caching for API data
- Can become unwieldy for large global state

**Recommendation:** Continue using for UI state like theming, but enhance with more specialized solutions for different state categories.

### 2. Zustand

**Pros:**

- Simple API with minimal boilerplate
- Excellent performance with selective re-renders
- Strong TypeScript support
- Small bundle size (2.8kB)
- Middleware system for extensions
- Compatible with existing React patterns
- Can be nested/composed for different state domains

**Cons:**

- Less mature ecosystem than Redux
- Requires learning a new pattern

**Recommendation:** Excellent choice for global UI state and as a general state manager. Would complement the existing approach well.

### 3. Redux Toolkit

**Pros:**

- Battle-tested, mature ecosystem
- Excellent developer tools
- Well-documented patterns for complex state
- Structured approach with strong conventions
- Good for teams with varying levels of experience

**Cons:**

- More boilerplate code than alternatives
- Larger bundle size
- Steeper learning curve
- May be overkill for this project's current needs

**Recommendation:** Consider if the application grows significantly more complex or if strong conventions are needed for a larger team.

### 4. Jotai

**Pros:**

- Atomic approach to state
- Small bundle size
- Excellent for component-specific state
- Good TypeScript support
- Simple mental model

**Cons:**

- Less established than other options
- Takes a different approach than the current codebase patterns

**Recommendation:** Good alternative to Zustand, but offers less clear benefits over the current approach for this project.

### 5. TanStack Query (React Query)

**Pros:**

- Excellent for server state management
- Built-in caching, polling, refetching, and request deduplication
- Handles loading and error states elegantly
- Integrates well with other state solutions
- Strong TypeScript support
- Developer tools
- Automatic revalidation and optimistic updates

**Cons:**

- Not designed for client-only state (would still need another solution)
- Learning curve for more advanced features

**Recommendation:** Highly recommended specifically for the API data fetching aspects of the application. Would pair well with either Zustand or the existing Context approach for UI state.

## Recommendations

Based on the evaluation against project requirements, the recommended approach is:

### 1. Hybrid Approach

Adopt a specialized hybrid approach using:

- **TanStack Query** for server state (quotes, readings, user data)
- **Zustand** for global UI state (navigation, modals, shared UI state)
- **React Context** for theme management (already implemented and optimized)
- **React's built-in hooks** for component-local state

### 2. Transition Plan

1. Adopt TanStack Query first to improve data fetching, caching, and error handling
2. Keep React Context for theme management (already optimized with memoization)
3. Create specific Zustand stores for different state domains as needed
4. Gradually migrate complex useReducer patterns to the new approach

### 3. Code Organization

- Group state by domain rather than by technical implementation
- Co-locate state with related components where possible
- Create a clean abstraction layer for API interactions using TanStack Query

## Sample Implementation

A proof-of-concept implementation will be provided in the next ticket (T30) to demonstrate how these tools would work together in the application.
