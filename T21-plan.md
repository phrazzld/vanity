# T21: Add Storybook to CI Pipeline - Implementation Plan

## Task Analysis

This task is about integrating Storybook build checks into the existing GitHub Actions CI workflow. This will ensure that Storybook builds correctly with each PR and commit to main, preventing issues with component documentation.

## Current CI Setup

The existing GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) currently performs the following checks:

- Checkout code
- Setup Node.js
- Install dependencies
- Generate Prisma client
- Check formatting
- Lint code
- Type check
- Run tests with coverage
- Upload coverage report
- Build the application

## Required Changes

We need to add a step to build Storybook and ensure it completes successfully, which will validate that:

1. All Storybook configuration files are valid
2. All component stories are properly structured
3. No errors occur during the Storybook build process

## Implementation Steps

1. Update the GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to include a new step that:

   - Runs the `npm run build-storybook` command
   - Ensures the command completes successfully
   - Places this step after the main application build step

2. Consider whether to:
   - Add a step to cache the Storybook build output for potential later use
   - Add an option to deploy the Storybook build to a preview environment (could be a future enhancement)

## Potential Challenges

- Build time: Storybook builds can sometimes be time-consuming. If the CI pipeline becomes too slow, we might need to optimize the Storybook build configuration or consider running it in parallel.
- Failures: If Storybook builds start failing, ensure clear error messages are provided in the CI output to help developers identify and fix issues quickly.

## Classification

This is a **Simple** task that involves adding a single step to an existing CI workflow file. No complex logic or design decisions are required.
