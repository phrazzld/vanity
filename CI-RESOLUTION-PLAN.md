# CI/CD Resolution Plan

This document outlines the strategic plan for implementing CI/CD improvements based on the analysis conducted in the CI-IMPROVEMENTS.md document.

## Implementation Schedule

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

**Security Scanning in Pre-Push Hook (T020)**

- **Action:** Implement pre-push security scanning hook to catch security issues before code reaches CI
- **Implementation:**
  1. Create dedicated security scanning script (`pre-push-security`)
  2. Integrate with existing pre-push hook while preserving functionality
  3. Test with various security scenarios
  4. Document usage in CONTRIBUTING.md
- **Status:** Draft implementation complete, ready for review
- **References:**
  - [Pre-push-security script](/.husky/pre-push-security)
  - [TODO.md Task T020](/TODO.md)

**CI Workflow Optimization**

- **Action:** Optimize CI workflow to reduce execution time
- **Implementation:**
  1. Parallelize compatible steps (lint, typecheck, format)
  2. Enhance caching strategy for Next.js, Prisma, and Storybook
  3. Implement selective execution based on changed files
  4. Add job dependency optimization
- **Status:** Documented in CI-WORKFLOW-OPTIMIZATIONS.md, implementation pending
- **References:** [CI-WORKFLOW-OPTIMIZATIONS.md](/CI-WORKFLOW-OPTIMIZATIONS.md)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Security (Week 2)

**Security Scanning Enhancements**

- **Action:** Implement additional security scanning tools in CI
- **Implementation:**
  1. Add SAST scanning with ESLint security plugins
  2. Implement secrets scanning with TruffleHog
  3. Generate and archive SBOM with CycloneDX
  4. Add Next.js-specific security checks
- **Status:** Documented in SECURITY-SCAN-ENHANCEMENTS.md, implementation pending
- **References:** [SECURITY-SCAN-ENHANCEMENTS.md](/SECURITY-SCAN-ENHANCEMENTS.md)

**Verify CI Pass/Fail Behavior (T021)**

- **Action:** Create test cases for CI behavior verification
- **Implementation:**
  1. Document test scenarios for pass/fail conditions
  2. Create verification matrix for security checks
  3. Test and verify expected behaviors
- **Status:** Pending
- **References:** [TODO.md Task T021](/TODO.md)

### Phase 3: Deployment Pipeline (Week 3-4)

**Environment-specific Deployments**

- **Action:** Implement dedicated workflows for different environments
- **Implementation:**
  1. Create staging deployment workflow
  2. Implement production deployment with approvals
  3. Add preview deployments for pull requests
- **Status:** Pending
- **References:** [CI-IMPROVEMENTS.md](/CI-IMPROVEMENTS.md)

**Release Automation**

- **Action:** Enhance release automation with standard-version integration
- **Implementation:**
  1. Create release workflow triggered by tags
  2. Automate changelog generation
  3. Implement release artifact creation
- **Status:** Pending
- **References:** [package.json release scripts](/package.json)

## Pre-Push Hook Integration

To implement task T020 (Add security scan to pre-push hook), we need to integrate the new security scanning functionality with the existing pre-push hook.

**Integration Strategy:**

1. **File Structure:**

   - Keep existing pre-push hook for code quality checks
   - Create separate pre-push-security script for security scanning
   - Modify pre-push to call pre-push-security

2. **Implementation:**

   ```sh
   # Add to end of pre-push (around line 311)

   # ========================================
   # Security vulnerability scan
   # ========================================
   echo "üîí Running security vulnerability scan..."
   if [ -f ".husky/pre-push-security" ]; then
     sh .husky/pre-push-security
   else
     echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Security scan script not found. Skipping security checks."
   fi
   ```

3. **Usage:**
   - All developers will automatically run security scans before pushing
   - Fast-feedback for security issues without waiting for CI
   - Can be bypassed with environment variable for emergencies:
     ```sh
     SKIP_SECURITY_SCAN=true git push
     ```

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Update pre-push hook to call pre-push-security script
2. Make pre-push-security executable
3. Create PR with these changes to implement T020
4. Prepare implementation for CI workflow optimizations
5. Document the changes in CONTRIBUTING.md
