## Assumptions & Clarifications Needed
1. **Color Extraction Feasibility**: The plan mentions extracting dominant colors from book covers. This requires either a server-side image processing solution or a client-side library. Clarification on the preferred approach would be helpful.

2. **Performance Boundaries**: Need to establish acceptable performance thresholds, especially for lower-end devices with the glass morphism effects.

3. **Browser Support**: The plan uses modern CSS features like backdrop-filter which has limited support in some browsers. Need to confirm target browsers and fallback strategies.

4. **Animation Complexity**: Some animations may require JavaScript for full implementation. Need to determine if pure CSS is preferred where possible or if JavaScript animations are acceptable.

5. **Design Consistency**: Need to ensure the refined ribbon aesthetics remain consistent with the overall application design language.
