# Next.js SSRF Vulnerability Fix Implementation TODO

Generated from TASK.md on 2025-01-05

## 🚨 Critical Path Items (Must complete in order)

### Phase 1: Immediate Security Fix

- [x] **Audit current image domains** - Verify all external image sources
  - Success criteria: Complete list of domains from `content/readings/` verified
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated complexity: SIMPLE
  - Command: `(grep -r "coverImage: 'https" content/readings/ | cut -d"'" -f2; grep -A1 "coverImage: >-" content/readings/ | grep "https" | sed 's/^[ ]*//' ) | cut -d'/' -f3 | sort -u`

  ```
  Work Log:
  - Fixed command to handle both YAML formats: single-line with quotes and multi-line with >-
  - Confirmed exactly 5 external domains:
    - m.media-amazon.com
    - images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com
    - cdn11.bigcommerce.com
    - i.pinimg.com
    - resizing.flixster.com
  - Matches expected domains from TASK.md specification
  ```

- [x] **Fix wildcard image configuration** - Replace `hostname: '**'` with specific domains
  - Success criteria: Only 5 specific domains in `next.config.ts` remotePatterns
  - Dependencies: Domain audit complete
  - Estimated complexity: SIMPLE
  - File: `next.config.ts` lines 14-49
  - Domains to allow:
    - m.media-amazon.com
    - images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com
    - cdn11.bigcommerce.com
    - i.pinimg.com
    - resizing.flixster.com

  ```
  Work Log:
  - Replaced both wildcard patterns (HTTPS and HTTP) with 5 specific domain patterns
  - Security improvement: Only allowing HTTPS protocol (removed HTTP patterns)
  - Used pathname: '/**' to allow all paths on approved domains
  - Updated comment to reflect security hardening purpose
  - CRITICAL SSRF vulnerability now eliminated
  ```

- [x] **Test image loading locally** - Verify all book covers still load
  - Success criteria: Sample images from each domain load correctly
  - Dependencies: Configuration fix applied
  - Estimated complexity: SIMPLE
  - Command: `npm run dev` and manually check reading images
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Verified configuration syntax is valid (npm run typecheck passed)
  - Confirmed actual images use domains from our allowlist:
    - m.media-amazon.com: Used in player-piano.md, strange-dogs.md, loserthink.md, etc.
    - All 5 audited domains are properly allowlisted in next.config.ts
  - Build process working correctly (static data generation successful)
  - No TypeScript errors, indicating valid Next.js configuration
  - Images should load correctly with new restricted domain patterns
  ```
