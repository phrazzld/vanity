## CI Security Scan Fix - CRITICAL

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix (Unblock CI) - Due: TODAY

#### [CI FIX] Add debug logging to audit filter script

- [x] Add console.log to output raw npm audit JSON before parsing in `src/lib/audit-filter/core.ts`

## Task: Add debug logging to audit filter script [x]

### Complexity: SIMPLE

### Started: 2025-08-05 14:41

### Completed: 2025-08-05 14:43

### Context Discovery

- Target file: src/lib/audit-filter/core.ts
- Need to log raw npm audit output before parsing
- This will help identify the actual format being produced

### Execution Log

[14:41] Read core.ts to understand parsing flow
[14:42] Added console.log for raw npm audit JSON after line 54
[14:42] Added detailed parsed structure logging in error path
[14:43] Enhanced error details to show Zod validation issues

### Changes Made

1. Added console.log to output raw npm audit JSON before parsing (line 57-59)
2. Added parsed JSON structure logging when schema validation fails (line 122-124)
3. Enhanced error details to show full Zod validation issues instead of just messages

### Learnings

- The parseNpmAuditJsonCanonical function already has good logging infrastructure
- Schema validation uses Zod's safeParse which provides detailed issue arrays
- Debug logging will now show both raw input and parsed structure in CI
- [x] Log npm version at start of security scan in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

## Task: Log npm version at start of security scan [x]

### Complexity: SIMPLE

### Started: 2025-08-05 14:46

### Completed: 2025-08-05 14:47

### Context Discovery

- Target file: .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Need to add npm version logging before security scan runs
- This will help identify npm version differences between local and CI

### Execution Log

[14:46] Read .github/workflows/ci.yml to find security scan job
[14:47] Found security_scan job starting at line 170
[14:47] Added npm and node version logging at line 247-251

### Changes Made

1. Added environment information logging section after line 245
2. Logs both npm version and node version for comprehensive debugging
3. Added blank line for better readability in CI output

### Learnings

- Security scan job runs after build-and-test job
- CI uses Node.js 20 (specified in setup-node@v4)
- npm version in CI may differ from local development environment
- [x] Add try-catch with detailed error logging around schema validation
- [ ] Deploy changes to see actual npm audit output format in CI logs

## Task: Add try-catch with detailed error logging around schema validation [x]

### Complexity: SIMPLE

### Started: 2025-08-07 09:45

### Completed: 2025-08-07 09:50

### Context Discovery

- Target file: src/lib/audit-filter/core.ts
- Schema validation happens via safeParse (doesn't throw)
- Normalization functions (normalizeV7PlusData, normalizeV6Data) might throw

### Execution Log

[09:45] Reading core.ts to identify schema validation locations
[09:46] Found validation points: normalizeV7PlusData and normalizeV6Data calls need error handling
[09:47] Added try-catch blocks around normalizeV7PlusData and normalizeV6Data
[09:48] Added detailed error logging including stack traces and data keys
[09:49] Added error handling around format detection function
[09:50] TypeScript compilation successful

### Changes Made

1. Added try-catch around normalizeV7PlusData with detailed error logging
2. Added try-catch around normalizeV6Data with detailed error logging
3. Added try-catch around detectNpmAuditFormat with fallback to 'unknown'
4. Each error handler logs: error message, stack trace, and data keys for debugging

### Learnings

- safeParse() doesn't throw errors, it returns success/error objects
- Normalization functions are where runtime errors might occur
- Detailed logging of data keys helps identify structure issues in CI

#### [CI FIX] Make audit filter parser more flexible

- [x] Update `src/lib/audit-filter/npmAudit.raw.schemas.ts` to handle `via` as string | object array
- [x] Add format detection logic to check structure before parsing
- [x] Create fallback parser for unrecognized formats that extracts basic vulnerability info
- [x] Test locally with `npm audit --json | node dist/scripts/audit-filter.js`

## Task: Make audit filter parser more flexible [x]

### Complexity: MEDIUM

### Started: 2025-08-06 15:23

### Completed: 2025-08-06 15:38

### Context Discovery

- npm audit v7+ format has `via` field that can be either string array or object array
- String format: references to other vulnerable packages (indirect dependencies)
- Object format: detailed vulnerability information with source, title, url, etc.

### Execution Log

[15:23] Read npmAudit.raw.schemas.ts to understand current structure
[15:24] Identified issue: `via` field only accepts object arrays
[15:25] Checked local npm audit output to confirm mixed format
[15:27] Updated VulnerabilitySchemaV7Plus schema with union type for `via`
[15:28] Added optional fields to ViaItemSchemaV7Plus for newer npm versions
[15:29] Fixed normalizer to handle both string and object formats
[15:31] TypeScript errors resolved successfully
[15:33] Added format detection function to identify npm v6 vs v7+ before parsing
[15:35] Created fallback parser for unrecognized formats
[15:37] Tested with local npm audit - confirmed mixed format handling

### Changes Made

1. Updated `via` field in VulnerabilitySchemaV7Plus to accept `z.union([z.array(z.string()), z.array(ViaItemSchemaV7Plus)])`
2. Added optional `cwe` and `cvss` fields to ViaItemSchemaV7Plus
3. Modified normalizeV7PlusData to skip string references in `via` array
4. Created detectNpmAuditFormat() function for format identification
5. Added fallbackParser() for unknown formats that extracts metadata
6. Refactored parseNpmAuditJsonCanonical to use format detection first

### Learnings

- npm v7+ uses mixed `via` formats: strings for indirect deps, objects for direct vulns
- Format detection before parsing provides better error messages
- Fallback parser ensures CI doesn't fail on new npm versions
- Schema flexibility is critical for npm audit compatibility across versions

#### [CI FIX] Quick workaround if needed

- [ ] Temporarily modify CI workflow to use `npm audit --audit-level=critical` without custom filter
- [x] Or add all current vulnerabilities to allowlist with short expiration dates
- [ ] Document this as temporary measure in PR description

## Task: Add all current vulnerabilities to allowlist with short expiration dates [x]

### Complexity: SIMPLE

### Started: 2025-08-07 09:58

### Completed: 2025-08-07 10:01

### Context Discovery

- Current vulnerabilities: 3 total (2 low severity ESLint, 1 critical form-data)
- Existing allowlist already had form-data entry
- ESLint vulnerability is indirect through @eslint/plugin-kit

### Execution Log

[09:58] Checking current npm audit vulnerabilities
[09:58] Found 3 vulnerabilities: 2 low (eslint-related), 1 critical (form-data)
[09:59] Reviewing existing allowlist - form-data already present
[09:59] Getting detailed vulnerability information for proper allowlist entries
[10:00] Added @eslint/plugin-kit vulnerability to allowlist with 2-week expiration
[10:01] Verified all vulnerabilities are now covered by allowlist entries

### Changes Made

1. Added GHSA-xffm-g5w8-qvg7 (@eslint/plugin-kit) to .audit-allowlist.json
2. Set expiration date to 2025-08-21 (2 weeks) for ESLint vulnerability
3. Kept existing form-data allowlist entry (expires 2025-09-01)

### Learnings

- Indirect vulnerabilities (via other packages) don't need separate allowlist entries
- Low severity vulnerabilities can be temporarily allowlisted to unblock CI
- Short expiration dates (2 weeks) ensure vulnerabilities are revisited soon

### Phase 2: Systematic Fix - Due: This Week

#### [CI FIX] Update npm audit schemas properly

- [x] Research npm audit output formats for npm v6, v7, v8, v9, v10
- [x] Create test fixtures for each format in `src/lib/audit-filter/fixtures/audit-outputs/`

## Task: Research npm audit formats and create test fixtures [x]

### Complexity: MEDIUM

### Started: 2025-08-07 10:04

### Completed: 2025-08-07 10:09

### Context Discovery

- Current npm version: 10.9.2
- Existing fixtures: only npm v6 single advisory example
- Need comprehensive documentation and test fixtures

### Execution Log

[10:04] Checking current npm version: 10.9.2
[10:04] Examining existing test fixtures directory structure
[10:05] Reading existing documentation about npm audit formats
[10:06] Created comprehensive NPM_AUDIT_FORMATS.md documentation
[10:07] Creating test fixtures for different npm versions
[10:08] Created npm v7 mixed via format test fixture
[10:08] Created npm v10 with CVSS scores test fixture
[10:09] Created npm v7 clean output test fixture

### Changes Made

1. Created docs/NPM_AUDIT_FORMATS.md with comprehensive format documentation
2. Created npm-v7-mixed-via.json showing mixed string/object via arrays
3. Created npm-v10-with-cvss.json showing CVSS score integration
4. Created npm-v7-clean.json showing clean audit output structure

### Approach Decisions

- Documented key differences between v6 (advisory-centric) and v7+ (package-centric)
- Highlighted the critical "via" field variations in v7+
- Created fixtures covering edge cases (mixed via, CVSS scores, clean output)

### Learnings

- npm v6 uses "advisories" object, v7+ uses "vulnerabilities" object
- v7 introduced auditReportVersion: 2 which persists through v10
- "via" field complexity is the main parsing challenge in v7+
- CVSS scores added in v8+, can have null vectorString
- [ ] Update schemas to handle all known format variations
- [ ] Add unit tests for each format variation

#### [CI FIX] Pin npm version in CI

- [x] Check current npm version locally with `npm --version`
- [x] Add npm version specification to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- [x] Update `package.json` engines field to specify npm version
- [x] Document npm version requirement in README.md

## Task: Pin npm version in CI [x]

### Complexity: SIMPLE

### Started: 2025-08-07 09:52

### Completed: 2025-08-07 09:56

### Context Discovery

- Local npm version: 10.9.2
- Local Node.js version: v22.15.0
- CI uses Node.js 20 (different from local, but acceptable)

### Execution Log

[09:52] Checked local npm version: 10.9.2
[09:52] Checked local Node.js version: v22.15.0
[09:53] Found setup-node configuration in CI workflow
[09:54] Added npm version pinning step to both CI jobs
[09:55] Updated package.json engines field with npm version requirement
[09:56] Updated README.md Prerequisites section

### Changes Made

1. Added "Pin npm version" step in .github/workflows/ci.yml after Node.js setup
2. Installs npm@10.9.2 globally in both build-and-test and security_scan jobs
3. Updated package.json engines field to require npm >=10.9.2
4. Updated README.md Prerequisites to specify npm 10.9.2+ requirement

### Learnings

- CI uses Node.js 20 while local uses v22.15.0 (backwards compatible)
- npm version can vary between environments if not explicitly pinned
- setup-node action doesn't pin npm version by default

#### [CI FIX] Implement format auto-detection

- [x] Create `detectAuditFormat()` function to identify npm audit version (completed in earlier task)
- [x] Route to appropriate parser based on detected format (completed in earlier task)
- [x] Add comprehensive error messages for unsupported formats (completed in earlier task)
- [x] Include remediation steps in error output (completed in earlier task)

### Phase 3: Long-term Improvements - Due: Next Sprint

#### [CI FIX] Comprehensive test coverage

- [ ] Add integration tests that run actual `npm audit` commands
- [ ] Create mock npm audit outputs for edge cases
- [ ] Add CI job that tests audit filter against multiple npm versions
- [ ] Set up automated alerts for npm audit format changes

#### [CI FIX] Documentation and maintenance

- [ ] Create `docs/NPM_AUDIT_FORMATS.md` with format specifications
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide to `docs/SECURITY_VULNERABILITY_MANAGEMENT.md`
- [ ] Create npm audit format migration guide
- [ ] Set up monitoring for npm audit format deprecations

#### [CI FIX] Architectural improvements

- [ ] Consider migrating to a more stable security scanning tool
- [ ] Evaluate using GitHub's built-in security scanning
- [ ] Create abstraction layer for security scanning tools
- [ ] Implement provider-agnostic vulnerability reporting

- [ ] Debug logs show npm audit output format

### After Phase 2

- [ ] Audit filter handles npm v6+ formats correctly
- [ ] CI uses consistent npm version
- [ ] Clear error messages for format issues

### After Phase 3

- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all formats
- [ ] Documentation complete and accessible
