## Remaining Tasks

### Test Infrastructure Improvements (2-4 hours) - BACKLOG

## The Carmack Cut Philosophy

_"It's done when there's nothing left to remove, not when there's nothing left to add."_

Every task above either:

1. Fixes an actual bug affecting users
2. Improves performance measurably
3. Reduces complexity permanently
4. Maintains code quality standards

No speculative features. No "might need later". No enterprise patterns for a personal blog.
