## Active Tasks

### Performance & Quality Validation

- [x] **Verify hover interactions maintain 60fps performance**
  - Success criteria: CSS hover animations run smoothly, no JavaScript render blocking
  - Tools: Browser dev tools performance profiling
  - Priority: Medium

  ```
  Work Log:
  - âœ… Created comprehensive hover performance test script (scripts/hover-performance-test.js)
  - âœ… Documented manual testing procedures (docs/hover-performance-validation.md)
  - âœ… Analyzed all hover patterns in codebase:
    * TypewriterQuotes: JavaScript pause on hover - necessary for UX
