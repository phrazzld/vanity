# TODO

## Critical Tasks for Current Branch (Must Complete Before Merge)

- [x] Fix test-logging-formats.js JSON structure validation bug - script expects nested `context` object but logger outputs flattened fields (`module_name`, `function_name` at root level)

## Notes

- This TODO represents critical path items that must be completed before merging the structured logging PR
- All other improvements have been created as GitHub issues for future work
- See STRUCTURED_LOGGING_SYNTHESIS.md for full analysis and context
