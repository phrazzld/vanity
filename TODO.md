## 📦 Phase 3: Content Migration (After CLI ships)

### Migrate Hardcoded Content to Markdown

- [ ] Update components to read from markdown
- [ ] Add `vanity project add` command
- [ ] Add `vanity place add` command

---

## 🔧 Phase 4: Production Cleanup

### Vercel & Deploy

- [ ] Create PR from `refactor/migrate-database-to-markdown`
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel preview
- [ ] Remove Neon database from Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Merge to main
- [ ] Monitor for any issues

### Code Quality

- [ ] Fix TypeScript errors in test files (remove db imports)
- [ ] Update ESLint config to allow `process` global
- [ ] Remove unused test files for deleted features
- [ ] Clean up `.next` build directory

---

## 💭 Future Ideas (YAGNI - Only if needed)

- [ ] File picker for local image selection (instead of typing path)
- [ ] Search functionality across all content
- [ ] RSS feed generation from markdown
- [ ] Tag system for quotes
- [ ] Reading statistics/charts
- [ ] Export to various formats (PDF, JSON)
- [ ] Backup automation to S3/GitHub

## Metrics

**Migration Results:**

- Lines deleted: 2000+
- Lines added: <200
- Database cost: $228/year → $0
- Deploy time: 30s → 10s
- Dependencies removed: 15+

**Time Investment:**

- Phase 1 (Migration): ✅ 4 hours
- Phase 2 (CLI): 4 hours estimated
- Phase 3 (Content): 2 hours estimated
- Phase 4 (Cleanup): 1 hour estimated

**Philosophy:**
Every line not written is a bug avoided. Every feature not built is complexity dodged. Ship the spike.
