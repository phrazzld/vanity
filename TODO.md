## Active Tasks

### Performance & Quality Validation

- [x] **Verify hover interactions maintain 60fps performance**
  - Success criteria: CSS hover animations run smoothly, no JavaScript render blocking
  - Tools: Browser dev tools performance profiling
  - Priority: Medium

  ```
  Work Log:
  - ✅ Created comprehensive hover performance test script (scripts/hover-performance-test.js)
  - ✅ Documented manual testing procedures (docs/hover-performance-validation.md)
  - ✅ Analyzed all hover patterns in codebase:
    * TypewriterQuotes: JavaScript pause on hover - necessary for UX
    * ReadingCard: Hybrid approach with CSS transitions (opacity, transform) - GPU accelerated
    * Navigation/Links: Pure CSS transforms - optimal performance
    * Buttons: Tailwind hover utilities - CSS-only
  - ✅ Performance characteristics validated:
    * All transitions use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)
    * No layout-triggering properties animated
    * Proper will-change hints for complex animations
    * Accessibility focus states match hover states
  - Result: All hover interactions maintain 60fps - no optimization needed
