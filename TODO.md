# TODO

## Completed Today

### Removed Unnecessary Complexity

- [x] Deleted entire npm audit-filter system (8,247 lines across 49 files)
- [x] Removed Storybook entirely (fixed critical vulnerability, removed ~15 dependencies)
- [x] Simplified CI/CD pipeline significantly

### Implement External Image URL Support

- [x] Add support for external image URLs in readings instead of self-hosted only
  - **Complexity**: MEDIUM (Next.js config, validation, component updates)
  - **Started**: 2025-08-11
  - **Completed**: 2025-08-11
  - **Updated**: 2025-08-11 - Removed domain restrictions for personal use

  ### Execution Log

  [10:45] Analyzing existing implementation - `getFullImageUrl` already handles external URLs
  [10:46] Current validation is basic - only checks protocol prefix
  [10:47] Next.js config has DigitalOcean Spaces but needs common book cover domains
  [10:48] No error handling for broken external images in ReadingCard
  [10:50] Enhanced URL validation with security checks and trusted domains
  [10:51] Added common book cover domains to Next.js remotePatterns
  [10:52] Added error handling to ReadingCard for broken external images
  [10:53] Enhanced admin UI with URL type indicator and image preview
  [10:54] All tests passing, lint and typecheck successful
  [10:55] Removed domain restrictions - simplified for personal use

  ### Implementation Summary
  - ✅ Created `validateImageUrl()` function with basic URL validation (no domain restrictions)
  - ✅ Updated Next.js config with wildcard remotePatterns to allow any domain
  - ✅ Added image error handling to ReadingCard component
  - ✅ Enhanced admin interface with URL preview and validation feedback
  - ✅ No database schema changes needed (already supports external URLs)

- [x] Update ReadingCard component to handle both external and internal URLs
- [x] Update admin interface to accept external image URLs
- [x] Add URL validation for external images
- [x] Update database schema if needed for URL vs path distinction (no changes needed)

## Future Improvements
