## Title: Set up mocking for external dependencies

## Original Ticket Text:

**T002 · Test · P0: Set up mocking for external dependencies**

- **Action:**
  1. Implement Jest mocks for `child_process.execSync`, `fs.readFileSync`, and `fs.existsSync`
  2. Ensure consistent mock behavior across all tests
- **Done-when:**
  1. All tests run without touching filesystem or spawning real processes
  2. Mock configurations are reusable across test suites
- **Depends-on:** [T001]

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt:

Based on the task details and the codebase context, I need to develop a comprehensive and actionable approach for setting up mocking for external dependencies in our Jest testing environment.

The goal is to create a systematic approach for mocking external dependencies - specifically `child_process.execSync`, `fs.readFileSync`, and `fs.existsSync` - to ensure that our tests can run in isolation without actually touching the filesystem or spawning real processes.

Questions to consider:

1. How should we structure these mocks to ensure they're reusable across test suites?
2. What mock implementations should we provide for each dependency?
3. How can we ensure type safety in our mocks?
4. How should we handle different mock scenarios (e.g., file exists vs. doesn't exist)?
5. What testing patterns should we establish for using these mocks?
6. How can we ensure our mocks align with the project's testing philosophy of only mocking at true external boundaries?

The solution should include:

1. A modular, type-safe approach to mocking these external dependencies
2. Clear patterns for setting up different mock scenarios
3. Examples of how to use the mocks in test files
4. Any necessary configuration in Jest setup files
5. Consideration of potential edge cases and error scenarios
