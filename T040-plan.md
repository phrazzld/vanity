# T040 Implementation Plan: Review and validate image import patterns

## Task Overview

Investigation task to analyze, verify, and document the current image import patterns in the projects page.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Pattern Analysis

- Compare current `@/../public/images/...` pattern with Next.js standard `/images/...`
- Research Next.js static asset handling documentation
- Analyze the resolved paths and webpack configuration impact

### 2. Path Verification

- Verify actual file paths exist in both local and CI environments
- Check image files are accessible via built URLs
- Test deployment artifact structure

### 3. Functionality Testing

- Verify images load correctly in browser after TypeScript declarations
- Test in development and production builds
- Check for any 404 errors or broken images

### 4. Performance Analysis

- Document any performance implications of current pattern
- Compare with standard Next.js patterns
- Note webpack bundling behavior

### 5. Documentation

- Create comprehensive findings document
- Include recommendations for T041 (optimization task)
- Document any issues or improvements needed

## Success Criteria

- Image import patterns validated as working correctly
- No broken images or 404 errors identified
- Performance impact documented
- Clear findings documented for follow-up optimization task

## Adherence to Development Philosophy

- Prioritize simplicity in documentation approach (clear, concise findings)
- Self-documenting evidence through testing and verification
- Focus on factual analysis over speculation
