# TD8 Plan: Fix SearchBar Component Snapshot Tests

## Problem

The SearchBar component has been modified to improve accessibility by moving the `role="search"` attribute from a div to the form element. This change has caused the snapshot tests to fail as they no longer match the current component structure.

From the task description:

> Snapshot test failures occurred after moving role="search" from a div to the form element for accessibility.

## Implementation Approach

1. Examine the current SearchBar component to understand the structural changes

   - Verify that `role="search"` has been moved from a div to the form element
   - Check for any other changes that might affect the snapshots

2. Examine the failing snapshot tests

   - Identify which snapshots need to be updated
   - Review current testing approach and ensure it follows best practices

3. Update the snapshots

   - Use Jest's snapshot update functionality (`jest --updateSnapshot` or `-u` flag)
   - Focus on the specific SearchBar component snapshots
   - Carefully verify that the new snapshots reflect the correct component structure

4. Verify no regressions
   - Run the full test suite to ensure no other tests are affected
   - Check that the SearchBar component still passes all functional tests

This approach aligns with the development philosophy of maintaining maintainable tests while improving accessibility. The changes will be focused and minimal, involving only the specific snapshot files for the SearchBar component.
