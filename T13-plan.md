# T13: Initialize and Configure Basic Storybook Setup - Implementation Plan

## Current State

I've examined the current Storybook setup in the project and found that much of the work for T13 has already been completed:

1. `.storybook/main.ts` already exists and is configured with:

   - Stories patterns
   - Essential addons (links, essentials, interactions, a11y, viewport, dark-mode)
   - Next.js framework integration
   - TypeScript configuration with React docgen
   - Static directories

2. `.storybook/preview.ts` has been configured with:

   - Action arguments
   - Control matchers
   - Background configurations
   - Dark mode settings
   - ThemeDecorator imported and applied

3. `.storybook/ThemeDecorator.tsx` has been implemented with:

   - Dark mode integration
   - Theme provider wrapping

4. `package.json` already contains the Storybook scripts:
   - `storybook` for running the dev server
   - `build-storybook` for building static output
   - `test-storybook` for running tests

## Remaining Tasks

Despite the existing setup, there are still a few tasks to complete for T13:

1. Verify the current configuration works by running Storybook
2. Check for any missing configurations or optimizations
3. Add a `.storybook/README.md` file documenting the setup and usage
4. Mark T13 as completed in the TODO.md file

## Implementation Steps

1. Run Storybook to verify the current setup
2. Create a `.storybook/README.md` file with usage documentation
3. Update the TODO.md file to mark T13 as completed
4. Commit the changes
