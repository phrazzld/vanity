# T002 Plan: Implement npm Audit in CI Pipeline

## Task Overview

Add npm audit to the security scan job in CI to detect high and critical security vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Implementation Approach

1. Locate the security_scan job in the CI workflow file
2. Add a new step that runs `npm audit --audit-level=high`
3. Configure the job to fail if the audit finds high or critical vulnerabilities

## Specific Changes

1. Edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to add the npm audit step to the security_scan job
2. Ensure the step fails the build if high or critical vulnerabilities are found
3. Add clear error messaging to help developers identify and fix issues

## Verification

1. Review workflow file to confirm correct configuration
2. The CI step should execute npm audit with high severity threshold
3. Builds should fail when high/critical vulnerabilities are detected
