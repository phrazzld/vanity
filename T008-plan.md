# T008 · Documentation · P2: Update README with Security Scan Information - Implementation Plan

## Overview

The task requires adding security scanning information to the README.md file, specifically in the Continuous Integration section, and linking to the security vulnerability management documentation.

## Current State

The README.md file already has a "Continuous Integration" section starting at line 325, but it doesn't mention security scanning. There's also a "Documentation" section starting at line 337 that lists various documentation files, but doesn't include the SECURITY_VULNERABILITY_MANAGEMENT.md file.

## Implementation Approach

1. Add a bullet point about security scanning to the existing Continuous Integration section
2. Add a reference to the SECURITY_VULNERABILITY_MANAGEMENT.md file in the Documentation section
3. Ensure the formatting is consistent with the rest of the README

## Verification

Review the changes to ensure:

1. The security scanning information is clear and accurate
2. The link to the vulnerability management documentation works correctly
3. The formatting is consistent with the rest of the README
