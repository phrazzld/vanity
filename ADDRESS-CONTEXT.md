## CRITICAL ISSUES

### [Missing Unit Tests for Critical Security Script (`audit-filter.ts`)] - BLOCKER

- **Location**: `scripts/audit-filter.ts` (entire file)
- **Violation**: Design for Testability ("Testability is a fundamental, non-negotiable design constraint").
- **Impact**: The core logic for security vulnerability filtering, which gates deployments, is completely untested. Regressions or errors in this script could silently allow vulnerabilities into production or incorrectly block valid changes. This is a severe reliability and security risk.
- **Fix**: Implement a comprehensive unit test suite for `audit-filter.ts` using Jest. Mock `child_process.execSync`, `fs.readFileSync`, and `fs.existsSync`. Test scenarios:
  - `npm audit` output: no vulnerabilities, various severities, new vulnerabilities, allowlisted vulnerabilities, expired allowlisted vulnerabilities.
  - Allowlist file: missing, empty, malformed JSON, valid entries (expired, not expired, expiring soon, no expiry date).
  - Correct exit codes for pass/fail conditions.
  - Correct parsing of advisory and allowlist data.

### [Lack of Structured Logging in Security Audit Script (`audit-filter.ts`)] - BLOCKER

- **Location**: `scripts/audit-filter.ts` (entire file, e.g., lines 65, 71, 96, 144, etc.)
- **Violation**: Logging Strategy ("All operational logging MUST be structured JSON", "console.log/error is forbidden for operational logs").
- **Impact**: The script uses `console.log`/`console.error` for all output. This prevents machine parsing, aggregation, and proper monitoring of a critical CI job. It violates fundamental operational requirements.
- **Fix**: Replace all `console.log` and `console.error` calls with a standardized structured logging library (as defined by the project, e.g., pino, winston). Ensure all log entries include mandatory fields like `timestamp`, `level`, `service: "security-audit-script"`, `message`, and any relevant context (e.g., package name, advisory ID).

### [Allowlist Expiration Policy Bypass (`audit-filter.ts`)] - BLOCKER

- **Location**: `scripts/audit-filter.ts:108-110` (`isAllowlistEntryExpired`)
- **Violation**: Explicit is Better than Implicit; Security Policy Enforcement (as per `docs/SECURITY_VULNERABILITY_MANAGEMENT.md` which implies expiration is key).
- **Impact**: The `isAllowlistEntryExpired` function returns `false` (not expired) if `entry.expires` is undefined. This allows vulnerabilities to be permanently allowlisted by omitting the `expires` field, directly contradicting the documented intent of regular review and temporary exceptions.
- **Fix**: Modify `isAllowlistEntryExpired` to treat an undefined `expires` field as an invalid entry or immediately expired. The script should fail or log a critical error if an allowlist entry lacks an `expires` field, enforcing the policy of mandatory expiration dates. Update example allowlist entries to always include `expires`.

### [Allowlist Format Not Validated Before Use (`audit-filter.ts`)] - BLOCKER

- **Location**: `scripts/audit-filter.ts:64` (`loadAllowlist`)
- **Violation**: Robustness; Security Considerations ("Input Validation").
- **Impact**: The script parses `.audit-allowlist.json` using `JSON.parse` without any schema validation. Malformed entries (e.g., incorrect field names, wrong data types for `id` or `package`, invalid date format for `expires`) could lead to the script misinterpreting the allowlist, silently bypassing intended filters, or causing runtime errors.
- **Fix**: Implement schema validation for the allowlist data immediately after parsing. Use a library like `zod` or `ajv` to define and enforce the expected structure, types, and formats for each allowlist entry. The script must fail loudly if the allowlist file does not conform to the schema.

### [Incomplete Critical Feature Verification in CI (Tasks T013, T014 Not Done)] - BLOCKER

- **Location**: `TODO.md` (Tasks T013, T014); `docs/SECURITY_TEST_VERIFICATION.md`
- **Violation**: Automation, Quality Gates, and CI/CD (ensuring the feature works as intended).
- **Impact**: The PR's own `TODO.md` lists "Verify CI Fail Case - New High/Critical Vulnerability" (T013) and "Verify CI Handles Allowlisted Vulnerabilities Correctly" (T014) as P1/P2 tasks that are _not completed_. `docs/SECURITY_TEST_VERIFICATION.md` only documents the pass case with no new vulnerabilities. The core functionality of this security feature is unproven in CI.
- **Fix**:
  1.  Immediately complete T013 and T014. Create temporary test branches/PRs that intentionally:
      a. Introduce a new, non-allowlisted high/critical vulnerability to confirm the CI job fails as expected.
      b. Introduce a vulnerability that _is_ correctly allowlisted (and not expired) to confirm the CI job passes.
  2.  Update `docs/SECURITY_TEST_VERIFICATION.md` with evidence (links to CI runs, logs) for these critical test cases.
  3.  Only then mark these tasks as complete in `TODO.md` (or remove the file if the feature is truly done).

### [Potential Sensitive Information Disclosure in Logs (`audit-filter.ts`)] - BLOCKER

- **Location**: `scripts/audit-filter.ts` (lines 268-273, 279-284, and similar)
- **Violation**: Security Considerations (Data Handling); Logging Strategy.
- **Impact**: The script prints vulnerability titles and URLs directly to `console.error`, which will appear in CI logs. Advisory titles or URLs could inadvertently contain sensitive details about exploits or internal systems if a vulnerability report is poorly worded or if an internal package has a vulnerability.
- **Fix**: Sanitize information printed to logs. For CI, only log minimal, non-sensitive identifiers like package name, advisory ID, and severity. Avoid printing full titles or URLs from advisories directly. If detailed info is needed for local debugging, make it conditional on an environment variable or flag not set in CI.

## SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS

### [Security Audit Script Not Integrated into Main Project Type-Checking Regimen] - HIGH

- **Location**: `package.json` (scripts `build:audit-filter`, `build:verify`); `tsconfig.typecheck.json`
- **Violation**: Coding Standards (Maximize Language Strictness); Simplicity First.
- **Impact**: `scripts/audit-filter.ts` is compiled with a bespoke `tsc` command (`npm run build:audit-filter`) that includes `--skipLibCheck` and is separate from the main project type-checking (`npm run typecheck`). This can lead to type inconsistencies or missed errors that would be caught by the stricter, project-wide configuration.
- **Fix**:
  1.  Ensure `scripts/audit-filter.ts` (and all other `.ts` scripts) are included in the `include` path of `tsconfig.typecheck.json`.
  2.  Remove the separate `tsc` call for `audit-filter.ts` from `build:verify`. The main `typecheck` command should cover it.
  3.  Remove `--skipLibCheck` from any build process related to this script; fix any underlying type issues it uncovers. The goal is for one strict type-checking command to validate the entire TypeScript codebase.

### [Missing Security Scan Step in Pre-Push Hook] - HIGH

- **Location**: `.husky/pre-push`
- **Violation**: Automation; Quality Gates (as per `CONTRIBUTING.md` updates and general best practice for such a feature).
- **Impact**: Developers can push code with new, non-allowlisted high/critical vulnerabilities without local validation. This delays feedback until CI runs, potentially allowing vulnerable code to persist on feature branches longer and increasing CI iteration time.
- **Fix**: Add `npm run security:scan` as a mandatory step in the `.husky/pre-push` hook. Ensure it runs after dependencies are likely installed/updated and before tests. The hook should fail if `npm run security:scan` exits with a non-zero code.

### [Insufficient Error Handling for Malformed/Missing Allowlist File (`audit-filter.ts`)] - HIGH

- **Location**: `scripts/audit-filter.ts:64-75` (`loadAllowlist`)
- **Violation**: Consistent Error Handling (Fail Predictably and Informatively).
- **Impact**: If `.audit-allowlist.json` exists but contains invalid JSON, `JSON.parse` throws, the error is logged, and an empty allowlist `[]` is returned. The script then proceeds as if no vulnerabilities are allowlisted. This can cause legitimate CI failures for vulnerabilities that _should_ be allowlisted, leading to confusion. If the file is missing, it also proceeds with an empty list, which is acceptable but should be an explicit INFO log, not potentially mixed with error paths.
- **Fix**:
  1.  If `ALLOWLIST_PATH` exists and `JSON.parse` fails, the script must `process.exit(1)` with a clear error message stating the allowlist file is corrupt and needs fixing. It should not silently proceed with an empty allowlist.
  2.  If `ALLOWLIST_PATH` does not exist, log this as an INFO message (e.g., "Allowlist file not found at ..., proceeding without allowlisted vulnerabilities.") rather than just a generic `console.log`.

### [Allowlist Expiration Logic is Timezone-Dependent and Potentially Flaky (`audit-filter.ts`)] - HIGH

- **Location**: `scripts/audit-filter.ts:108-124` (`isAllowlistEntryExpired`, `willExpireSoon`)
- **Violation**: Robustness; Determinism.
- **Impact**: Date comparisons use `new Date()` for "today" and parse `entry.expires` potentially without explicit timezone handling. This makes the exact moment of expiry dependent on the server's timezone where the script runs (local machine vs. CI runner). This can lead to builds failing/passing inconsistently around the cut-off day.
- **Fix**: Standardize all date operations on UTC. When parsing `entry.expires`, assume it's a UTC date (or enforce `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` format). Get "today's" date in UTC. Use a robust date library (e.g., `date-fns-tz`, `luxon`) to handle date parsing and comparisons reliably in UTC.

### [`npm audit` Output Parsing is Brittle and Lacks Version Adaptability (`audit-filter.ts`)] - HIGH

- **Location**: `scripts/audit-filter.ts:80-97` (`runNpmAudit`), `scripts/audit-filter.ts:174-176` (accessing `auditResult.advisories`)
- **Violation**: Robustness; Simplicity First (Fragile Logic).
- **Impact**: The script hardcodes parsing for a specific `npm audit --json` output structure (expecting an `advisories` key). The `npm audit` JSON format has changed across major npm versions (e.g., `vulnerabilities` in newer versions). The script will fail or misinterpret results if run with an incompatible npm version.
- **Fix**:
  1.  Inspect the `npm audit --json` output to determine the structure. Check for `auditResult.vulnerabilities` first; if not found, fall back to `auditResult.advisories`.
  2.  Log which format is being used.
  3.  Fail explicitly if neither expected top-level key for vulnerabilities is found.
  4.  Consider adding a check for the `npm` version or documenting the versions this script is compatible with.

## SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS

### [Potentially Unwanted Planning Artifacts Committed to Version Control] - MEDIUM

- **Location**: `PLAN-CONTEXT.md`, `T002-plan.md`, `TODO.md`
- **Violation**: Simplicity First (Repository Clutter).
- **Impact**: These files represent transient planning or task tracking for this specific feature. Once the feature is merged and stable, they become historical noise in the codebase, potentially confusing future developers. `TODO.md` showing incomplete P1 tasks for a "done" feature is particularly problematic.
- **Fix**:
  1.  Remove `T002-plan.md`. Its content is better suited for PR descriptions or commit messages.
  2.  Once this PR's critical verification tasks (T013, T014) are complete, remove `TODO.md`. Its history can live in the PR.
  3.  Evaluate if `PLAN-CONTEXT.md`'s essential rationale is adequately covered by `docs/SECURITY_VULNERABILITY_MANAGEMENT.md` and this PR's description. If so, remove it. If kept, ensure it's clearly marked as historical context.

### [Example Data in Production Allowlist File (`.audit-allowlist.json`)] - MEDIUM

- **Location**: `.audit-allowlist.json`
- **Violation**: Clarity; Documentation Approach (Consistency).
- **Impact**: The committed `.audit-allowlist.json` contains example entries. However, `docs/SECURITY_VULNERABILITY_BASELINE.md` states "The current codebase has no detected vulnerabilities...". This creates confusion: are these examples live allowlist entries or just placeholders? If they are just examples, they shouldn't be in the primary allowlist file that the script uses.
- **Fix**:
  1.  If the project currently has NO vulnerabilities needing allowlisting, `.audit-allowlist.json` should be an empty array `[]`.
  2.  Provide examples only in documentation (e.g., `SECURITY_VULNERABILITY_MANAGEMENT.md`) or in a separate, clearly named example file like `.audit-allowlist.example.json` that is not directly used by the script.

### [Use of Type Assertions (`as`) in `audit-filter.ts` Bypasses Type Safety] - MEDIUM

- **Location**: `scripts/audit-filter.ts` (e.g., line 76, 91, 131)
- **Violation**: TypeScript Best Practices (Leverage Types Diligently).
- **Impact**: Type assertions (`as NpmAuditResult`, `as Error`) tell the compiler to trust the developer, bypassing type checking. If the actual structure of `npm audit` output or error objects differs, this can lead to runtime errors that TypeScript would otherwise catch.
- **Fix**: Replace type assertions with proper type guards or runtime validation where possible. For `JSON.parse` results, validate the parsed object's structure against the expected interface. For error objects, use `instanceof Error` and check for specific properties before accessing them.

### [Redundant/Confusing "Verify build" Step in Pre-Push Hook] - MEDIUM

- **Location**: `.husky/pre-push` (lines 263-284)
- **Violation**: Simplicity First; DRY.
- **Impact**: The new "Verify build" step runs `npm run build:verify`, which itself runs `tsc -p tsconfig.typecheck.json --noEmit` and then another `tsc` command specifically for `scripts/audit-filter.ts`. This is largely redundant if:
  a. `npm run typecheck` (already in the pre-push hook) correctly includes all necessary files via `tsconfig.typecheck.json`.
  b. The `build:audit-filter` script (used by `security:scan`) already compiles `audit-filter.ts`.
  The messaging "Fix the TypeScript errors that only appear in production builds" is misleading if it's only running `tsc --noEmit`.
- **Fix**:
  1.  Ensure `scripts/audit-filter.ts` is covered by the main `npm run typecheck` (via `tsconfig.typecheck.json`).
  2.  If the goal of "Verify build" is to check if `npm run build` (the actual Next.js production build) succeeds, then the script should run that.
  3.  If it's just for type checking, it's redundant with the existing `npm run typecheck` step. Remove or clarify its distinct purpose. The current implementation adds complexity and pre-push time for little clear benefit over existing checks.

## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

### [Unused Allowlist Fields Not Displayed in Script Output (`audit-filter.ts`)] - LOW

- **Location**: `scripts/audit-filter.ts` (console output sections)
- **Violation**: Explicitness; Utility.
- **Impact**: The `AllowlistEntry` interface includes `notes` and `reviewedOn`, but these fields are not printed to the console when displaying allowed or expired vulnerabilities. This hides potentially useful context from developers viewing CI logs.
- **Fix**: Modify the console output in `main()` to include the `notes` and `reviewedOn` fields (if present) for each displayed allowlisted or expired vulnerability.

### [Missing `reviewedOn` Field in Second Allowlist Example (`.audit-allowlist.json`)] - LOW

- **Location**: `.audit-allowlist.json:10`
- **Violation**: Documentation Consistency (Example Quality).
- **Impact**: The second example entry for `demo-package` is missing the `reviewedOn` field, while the first example and the documentation (`SECURITY_VULNERABILITY_MANAGEMENT.md`) mention it. This makes the example inconsistent.
- **Fix**: Add a `reviewedOn: "2025-05-20"` field to the second example entry in `.audit-allowlist.json` for completeness and consistency.

### [`build:audit-filter` Script Uses `--skipLibCheck`] - LOW

- **Location**: `package.json` (line for `build:audit-filter`)
- **Violation**: Coding Standards (Maximize Language Strictness).
- **Impact**: `--skipLibCheck` in the build script for `audit-filter.ts` might hide type errors originating from its dependencies (`.d.ts` files). While the main project type-check might catch these if the script is included, it's poor practice for a dedicated build step.
- **Fix**: Remove `--skipLibCheck` from the `build:audit-filter` script. If this reveals type errors, address them directly by fixing types or adding appropriate type declarations for dependencies.

### [Shebang `#!/usr/bin/env node` in `audit-filter.ts` is Redundant] - LOW

- **Location**: `scripts/audit-filter.ts:1`
- **Violation**: Simplicity First (Minor Code Hygiene).
- **Impact**: The script is executed via `node dist/scripts/audit-filter.js` (as per `package.json` and CI workflow). The shebang is therefore not used and is superfluous.
- **Fix**: Remove the shebang line if the script is not intended to be executed directly as an executable file.

### [No Explicit Node.js Version Enforcement for `audit-filter.ts` in `package.json`] - LOW

- **Location**: `package.json`
- **Violation**: Consistency; Environment Management.
- **Impact**: While the CI job specifies `node-version: '20'`, local development environments might vary. The script could inadvertently use Node.js 20 features that break on older Node versions used by other developers if they run `npm run security:scan` locally without `nvm use` or similar.
- **Fix**: Add an `engines` field to `package.json` specifying the required Node.js version (e.g., `">=20"`). This provides a clearer signal and can be enforced by some environments.
