# T024 Plan: Remove example data from production

## Task Context

Remove example entries from production allowlist and move them to appropriate documentation or test fixtures to ensure clean production environment.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Identify Current Example Data

- Locate existing allowlist files containing example entries
- Review what constitutes "example" vs legitimate production entries
- Identify files that need to be cleaned up

### 2. Move Examples to Appropriate Locations

- Update documentation with proper examples
- Move test-specific examples to test fixtures
- Ensure examples remain available for reference but not in production

### 3. Clean Production Allowlist

- Remove example entries from production allowlist
- Ensure remaining entries are legitimate production needs
- Validate allowlist still functions correctly

## Adherence to Development Philosophy

- **Simplicity First**: Remove unnecessary complexity from production
- **Security**: Ensure no test/example data leaks into production
- **Documentation**: Preserve examples in appropriate documentation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Example entries removed from production allowlist
- [ ] Examples preserved in documentation or test fixtures
- [ ] Production allowlist contains only legitimate entries
- [ ] Documentation updated as needed
