# Task Description

## Overview

Integrate Automated Security Vulnerability Scanning into CI Pipeline

## Requirements

- Add a mandatory CI stage that scans code and dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- Implement failure mechanism for CI pipeline when new critical or high-severity vulnerabilities are detected
- Follow "Automation (CI/CD Quality Gates)" and "Security (Dependency Management Security)" philosophies
- Consider using `pnpm audit --level high` or tools like Snyk/Dependabot for the scanning

## Technical Context

- The project is currently using npm, not pnpm (future backlog item includes migration to pnpm)
- Project is a Next.js application with TypeScript
- Current branch name suggests focus on infrastructure and CI/CD improvements: plan/infrastructure-ci-cd
- Vercel appears to be the deployment platform based on the existence of vercel.json
- The project has ESLint, Jest for testing, and husky for git hooks

## Considerations

- Implementation should work with current npm setup but ideally be easily adaptable for future pnpm migration
- The security scanning should be comprehensive but avoid false positives that could block development
- Consider both code scanning and dependency scanning approaches
- Need to determine the appropriate threshold for failing builds (critical only, high and critical, etc.)
- Implementation should include documentation on handling vulnerability reports and remediation process
