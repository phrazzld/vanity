# Bug Fix Plan - NextAuth Compatibility Issue

## 1. Bug Description
The Vercel deployment is failing during the build process due to a dependency conflict between Next.js 15 and NextAuth v4.24.5. The specific error relates to NextAuth requiring Next.js 12, 13, or 14, but the project is using Next.js 15.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Push changes to the 'feat/secure-auth' branch
2. Vercel attempts to deploy the branch
3. Build process fails during `npm install` due to peer dependency conflict

### Expected vs Actual Behavior
- **Expected**: Successful installation of dependencies and build completion
- **Actual**: Build failure with npm error `ERESOLVE could not resolve`

### Key Components
- **Next.js version**: 15.2.3
- **NextAuth version**: 4.24.5
- Peer dependency requirement: NextAuth requires Next.js ^12.2.5 || ^13 || ^14

## 2. Likely Causes

1. **Next.js version too new for NextAuth**
   - Reason: NextAuth v4.24.5 explicitly lists compatible Next.js versions (12, 13, or 14) but we're using Next.js 15
   - Quick test: Check package.json for version numbers

2. **Missing build flags in Vercel**
   - Reason: The build works locally but fails on Vercel
   - Quick test: Check if we have a Vercel configuration file or build command settings that might include `--legacy-peer-deps` or `--force`

3. **NextAuth needs upgrading to a newer version**
   - Reason: The current version might not be compatible with Next.js 15
   - Quick test: Check if there's a newer version of NextAuth that supports Next.js 15

## 3. Test Results

### Task 1: Examine package.json for dependency versions
- **Findings**: The package.json confirms:
  - Next.js version: 15.2.3
  - NextAuth version: 4.24.5
  - As per the error message, NextAuth v4.24.5 requires Next.js version 12.2.5, 13, or 14, not 15

### Task 2: Check for newer NextAuth versions
- **Findings**: 
  - The latest stable version is 4.24.5
  - There are beta versions available with the latest being 5.0.0-beta.25
  - Previously, we were using 5.0.0-beta.25 but downgraded to 4.24.5
  - No explicit documentation about Next.js 15 compatibility was found

### Task 3: Test local builds with --legacy-peer-deps
- **Findings**:
  - `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` successfully installs dependencies
  - Local build with `npm run build` works successfully
  - The flag bypasses peer dependency checks, allowing Next.js 15 to work with NextAuth 4.24.5
  - This confirms our local development environment works because we're using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag

## 4. Root Cause

The root cause of the build failure is that NextAuth v4.24.5 explicitly declares support for Next.js ^12.2.5 || ^13 || ^14, but our project is using Next.js 15.2.3. The peer dependency conflict causes the Vercel build to fail, while local builds work because we are using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.

## 5. Potential Solutions

1. **Upgrade to NextAuth v5 beta**
   - Pros: May have better compatibility with Next.js 15
   - Cons: Beta software may introduce new bugs or stability issues
   - Implementation: `npm install next-auth@5.0.0-beta.25 --save`

2. **Configure Vercel to use `--legacy-peer-deps`**
   - Pros: Quick solution that mimics our local development environment
   - Cons: Masks the underlying compatibility issue, may cause runtime issues
   - Implementation: Create a vercel.json file to customize install command

3. **Downgrade Next.js to version 14**
   - Pros: Ensures compatibility with NextAuth v4
   - Cons: Loses features/benefits of Next.js 15
   - Implementation: `npm install next@14 --save`

After evaluating these options, we initially tried option 1 (upgrading to NextAuth v5 beta), but encountered integration issues with imports and type errors. We then implemented option 2 by creating a vercel.json configuration file to use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag during Vercel builds.

## 6. Fix Implementation

We've implemented two changes to resolve the issue:

1. **Created vercel.json to use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag**
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "builds": [
       {
         "src": "package.json",
         "use": "@vercel/next",
         "config": {
           "installCommand": "npm install --legacy-peer-deps"
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Reverted to NextAuth v4.24.5**
   - We tried upgrading to v5 beta but encountered integration issues
   - Returned to v4.24.5 with the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to bypass peer dependency checks

This approach allows us to continue using Next.js 15 with NextAuth v4.24.5 by instructing Vercel to ignore peer dependency conflicts during installation, mirroring our local development environment.

## 7. Verification and Future Recommendations

After implementing the fix, we need to:

1. **Push changes to verify Vercel deployment** 
   - The vercel.json configuration should allow successful builds

2. **Consider Long-term Solutions**
   - Monitor NextAuth for official Next.js 15 support
   - Consider downgrading to Next.js 14 if stability issues arise
   - Keep dependencies aligned with their officially supported integrations

3. **Additional Safeguards**
   - Add a note in the README about using `--legacy-peer-deps` for local development
   - Set up CI checks to detect potential compatibility issues before deployment
