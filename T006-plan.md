# T006 · Documentation · P2: Document developer workflow for security scanning - Implementation Plan

## Overview

Create documentation for developers on how to run security scans locally and how to handle security vulnerabilities when they are found.

## Implementation Approach

1. Check if `docs/SECURITY_VULNERABILITY_MANAGEMENT.md` already exists (created in T003)
2. If exists, update it to include:
   - Instructions for running local security scans using the npm scripts added in T005
   - Step-by-step process for dealing with found vulnerabilities
3. If it doesn't exist, create it with these sections:
   - Introduction to security scanning
   - How to run scans locally (npm scripts)
   - How to interpret scan results
   - Process for dealing with found vulnerabilities:
     - Updating dependencies
     - Adding entries to the allowlist with proper justification
   - Best practices for security

## Verification

1. Follow the documentation to run a local security scan
2. Verify all steps are clear and accurate
