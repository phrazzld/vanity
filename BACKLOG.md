  - Early termination on failure

### Quality Infrastructure (from /gates audit)

- [ ] **[QUALITY]** Consolidate bundle-size workflow into main CI | **Effort: S** | **Impact: Simpler pipeline**
  - Merge bundle-size.yml checks into ci.yml to reduce workflow complexity
  - Single workflow easier to maintain and debug

- [ ] **[TESTING]** Add mutation testing for lib/ directory | **Effort: M** | **Impact: Verify test quality**
  - Use Stryker Mutator to test if tests actually catch bugs
  - Target: >60% mutation score for core logic
  - Reveals if 27% coverage is effective or just theater

## MEDIUM Priority

_Valuable improvements and new features_

### Quality Automation

- [ ] **[QUALITY]** Implement quality gates | **Effort: S**
  - Pre-commit: coverage checks, ESLint max-lines (400)
  - CI/CD: Block PRs below 80% coverage for new code
  - Add complexity limits and dead code detection

### Features

- [ ] **[FEATURE]** Content validation pipeline | **Effort: M** | Build-time validation and auto-formatting

- [ ] **[CLEANUP]** Remove all unused .env.production variables | **Effort: S** | Including obsolete NEXT_PUBLIC_SPACES_BASE_URL
- [ ] **[CLEANUP]** Unify logging approach | **Effort: S** | Standardize on single logging method

### Optimizations

- [ ] **[PERF]** Implement component memoization | **Effort: M** | For large list rendering
- [ ] **[PERF]** Add virtual scrolling | **Effort: M** | For reading lists > 100 items

### Future Features

- [ ] **[FEATURE]** Reading metadata enhancements | **Effort: M** | Narrator info, playback speed

## ðŸ”„ Quality Gates (To Implement)

### Phase 1: Pre-commit Hooks

- [ ] ESLint max-lines enforcement
- [ ] Incremental coverage checks
- [ ] Secret scanning
- [ ] Duplicate code detection

### Phase 2: CI/CD Pipeline

- [ ] Coverage thresholds (80% new code)
- [ ] Performance budgets (<100ms API)
- [ ] Visual regression testing
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning

### Phase 3: Monitoring

- [ ] Error rate alerts (<0.1%)
- [ ] Performance degradation detection
- [ ] Dependency update automation

## âš¡ RADICAL SIMPLIFICATION OPTIONS (v2.0)

_Alternative approach: Dramatically simplify instead of improving. Choose this OR the improvements above, not both._

### Completed Simplifications

- [x] ~~Eliminate database + admin â†’ static Markdown~~ | **âœ… DONE** | Saved $228/year, removed 2300 lines

### Potential Future Simplifications

Consider these if complexity becomes unmanageable:

- [ ] **[GORDIAN]** Replace interactive map with static image | **Code reduction: 18%** | Removes Leaflet dependencies
- [ ] **[GORDIAN]** Replace Zustand with localStorage | **Code reduction: 15%** | For simple theme toggle
- [ ] **[GORDIAN]** Remove CLI tool entirely | **Code reduction: 12%** | Just edit markdown directly
- [ ] **[GORDIAN]** Simplify Tailwind to basic utilities | **Code reduction: 20%** | Remove design system complexity

**Note:** These simplifications would eliminate many of the improvements listed above. Choose one path:

1. **Improve** - Implement the backlog items above
2. **Simplify** - Remove features and complexity entirely
