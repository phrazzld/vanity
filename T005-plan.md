# T005 · Feature · P2: Add NPM Scripts for Local Security Scanning - Implementation Plan

## Overview

Add npm scripts to package.json to enable developers to run security scans locally with simple commands.

## Implementation Approach

1. Read the current package.json file to understand the existing scripts
2. Add the following scripts to the scripts section:
   ```json
   "security:audit": "npm audit --audit-level=high",
   "security:scan": "npm run security:audit"
   ```
3. Check for any existing custom audit scripts that might already exist from tasks T003/T004
4. If needed, update the security:scan script to use our custom audit filter script instead of the basic npm audit

## Verification

1. Run the scripts locally to verify they execute correctly
2. Ensure the scripts work correctly with the existing audit filter implementation
