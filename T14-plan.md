# T14: Configure Tailwind CSS Integration in Storybook - Implementation Plan

## Task Analysis

This task requires ensuring that Tailwind CSS styles are properly integrated into Storybook. The primary action is to import the globals.css file into the Storybook preview configuration and verify that Tailwind CSS styles are being properly applied to components in Storybook.

## Current State Assessment

Let's first check the current state of Tailwind CSS integration in Storybook:

1. Check if globals.css is already imported in .storybook/preview.ts
2. Verify postcss configuration for Storybook to process Tailwind
3. Test if Tailwind classes are working correctly in Storybook

## Implementation Steps

1. **Check Current Configuration**:

   - Review `.storybook/preview.ts` to see if globals.css is already imported
   - Examine `.storybook/main.ts` to see if there's any CSS/PostCSS configuration
   - Check `postcss.config.mjs` to understand the project's PostCSS setup

2. **Update Configuration**:

   - If globals.css is not imported in preview.ts, add the import
   - If needed, add or update PostCSS configuration in Storybook to ensure Tailwind processing

3. **Verify Integration**:

   - Run Storybook and check if Tailwind classes are properly applied
   - Test both utility classes and components that rely on Tailwind
   - Ensure that dark mode classes work correctly if applicable

4. **Document Changes**:
   - Add notes to `.storybook/README.md` about Tailwind CSS integration
   - Update TODO.md to mark the task as completed

## Success Criteria

- Tailwind CSS utility classes work correctly in Storybook
- Components that use Tailwind CSS classes render as expected in Storybook
- Dark mode functionality works if it relies on Tailwind's dark: variants
