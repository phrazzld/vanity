# T018 Implementation Plan

## Task: Include security script in main TypeScript checking

### Current Analysis

Evidence suggests this task may already be completed:

1. **TypeScript Compilation Verification**: Using `npx tsc --listFiles -p tsconfig.typecheck.json | grep audit-filter` shows:

   - `scripts/audit-filter.ts` IS already included in TypeScript compilation
   - `scripts/audit-filter-new.ts` is also included
   - All audit-filter modules in `src/lib/audit-filter/` are included

2. **Type Checking Status**: `npm run typecheck` passes without errors, confirming security scripts are being type-checked successfully.

3. **Configuration Analysis**:
   - `tsconfig.json` includes `"**/*.ts"` pattern which captures `scripts/audit-filter.ts`
   - `tsconfig.typecheck.json` extends the main config and also includes `"**/*.ts"`
   - No exclusions exist for the scripts directory

### Implementation Approach

Following the **Simplicity First** principle from DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md:

1. **Verify Current State**: Confirm security scripts are indeed being type-checked
2. **Document Evidence**: Capture proof that the task requirements are met
3. **Complete Task**: If already complete, mark as done; if gaps exist, address them minimally

### Success Criteria

- [ ] `scripts/audit-filter.ts` is included in main TypeScript type checking
- [ ] CI type checking includes security scripts (verified via `npm run typecheck`)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in security scripts
- [ ] Evidence documented that both done-when criteria are satisfied

### Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Task appears already complete
- **Verification Required**: Ensure no configuration gaps exist
