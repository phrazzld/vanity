## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and npm 10.9.2+
- Git
- Text editor (for content creation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phrazzld/vanity.git
   cd vanity
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables (optional)

   ```bash
   # Create a .env file with:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SPACES_BASE_URL="your_image_hosting_url"  # For reading cover images
   ```

4. Start the development server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Content Management

Content is managed through markdown files and a custom CLI tool. All content is stored in the `/content/` directory.

### Adding Quotes

```bash
# Add a new quote (opens your $EDITOR for quote and author)
npm run vanity -- quote add

# List recent quotes
npm run vanity -- quote list
npm run vanity -- quote list -n 20  # Show 20 quotes
```

Quotes are saved as `/content/quotes/[ID].md` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
author: 'Author Name'
id: 42
---

The quote text goes here.
```

### Adding Readings

```bash
# Add a new reading (interactive prompts)
npm run vanity -- reading add

# Update a reading (mark finished, add thoughts, delete)
npm run vanity -- reading update

# List recent readings
npm run vanity -- reading list
npm run vanity -- reading list -n 5  # Show 5 readings
```

Readings support:

- **Two-state system**: Currently reading or finished (simplified from previous three-state system)
- **Audiobook support**: Mark readings as audiobooks with 🎧 indicators in the UI
- **Cover images**: URLs or local files (auto-optimized to WebP at 400x600px)
- **Status management**: Easy updates via CLI to mark books as finished
- **Optional thoughts**: Add personal notes via $EDITOR
- **File deletion**: Remove readings entirely through update command
- **Saved as**: `/content/readings/[slug].md` with YAML frontmatter

### CLI Configuration

- Set `EDITOR` environment variable for preferred editor (default: `vi`)
- Example: `export EDITOR=nvim`

### Content Structure

```
content/
├── quotes/
│   ├── 0001.md
│   ├── 0002.md
│   └── ...
└── readings/
    ├── book-title.md
    └── ...

public/images/readings/
└── book-title.webp  # Optimized cover images
```

### Reading File Format

Readings are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: 'The Pragmatic Programmer'
author: 'David Thomas and Andrew Hunt'
finished: 2023-06-15T00:00:00.000Z # null for currently reading
audiobook: true # Optional, defaults to false
coverImage: '/images/readings/pragmatic-programmer.webp'
---

Optional thoughts and notes about the book go here.
```

**Reading Status:**

- **Currently Reading**: `finished: null`
- **Finished**: `finished: 2023-06-15T00:00:00.000Z` (ISO date string)
- **Audiobook**: `audiobook: true` (shows 🎧 indicator in UI)

### Troubleshooting

- **Build Errors**: Check for TypeScript errors with `npm run typecheck`.
- **Missing Content**: Ensure content directories exist: `/content/quotes/` and `/content/readings/`.
- **Image Issues**: Check that NEXT_PUBLIC_SPACES_BASE_URL is set for reading cover images.

## Development Philosophy

This project follows a set of core principles to ensure maintainable, secure, and high-quality code:

### Core Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Resist unnecessary complexity and over-engineering
2. **Modularity is Mandatory**: Small, focused components with clear responsibilities
3. **Testability by Design**: Code structured for comprehensive testing
4. **Explicit Intent**: Clear, readable code with explicit dependencies
5. **Secure by Default**: Security integrated into the development process
6. **Automate Everything**: Extensive automation for consistency and efficiency

For detailed information, see [DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md).

### Code Style

- Strict TypeScript with explicit types and minimal use of `any`
- Feature-focused organization rather than technical layers
- Functional components with explicit return types
- Detailed JSDoc comments for components and functions
- Consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities)

## Accessibility

This project is committed to WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, ensuring the application is usable by people with various disabilities:

### Key Accessibility Features

- Semantic HTML structure with appropriate ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support throughout the application (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space)
- Color contrast ratios that meet WCAG standards in both light and dark themes
- Focus management for modals and interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility with descriptive alt text and labels
- Accessible hover interactions with keyboard focus equivalence (audiobook indicators)

### Keyboard Navigation

The project includes comprehensive keyboard navigation utilities:

- Focus trapping for modals and dialogs
- Arrow key navigation within components
- Skip links to bypass navigation elements
- Focus management and restoration

For more details, see [KEYBOARD_NAVIGATION.md](docs/KEYBOARD_NAVIGATION.md) and [ACCESSIBILITY.md](docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md).

## State Management

The project uses a hybrid approach to state management:

- **Server State**: Native fetch API for loading static markdown data
- **UI State**: Zustand for simple, lightweight global state management
- **Local State**: React's useState and useReducer for component-specific state

This approach separates concerns and provides optimal solutions for different types of state. For details, see [STATE_MANAGEMENT.md](docs/STATE_MANAGEMENT.md).

## Testing Strategy

The project follows a comprehensive testing approach:

- **Unit Tests**: For utility functions and isolated logic
- **Component Tests**: Using React Testing Library with user-centric approach
- **Integration Tests**: For API routes and data flow
- **Accessibility Tests**: Using jest-axe for automated accessibility checks
- **Snapshot Tests**: For UI regression testing

Guidelines:

- Test behavior, not implementation
- Mock external dependencies only (not internal collaborators)
- Focus on user interactions rather than implementation details

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming Conventions

- Main branches: `main` or `master`
- Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
- Bug fix branches: `fix/bug-description`
- Documentation branches: `docs/what-was-documented`
- Refactoring branches: `refactor/what-was-refactored`
- Release branches: `release/vX.Y.Z` (semantic versioning)
- Development branches: `dev` or `develop`
- Planning branches: `plan/plan-description`

### Git Hooks

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Lint, format, typecheck, and detect sensitive data
- **Post-commit Hooks**: Generate documentation
- **Pre-push Hooks**: Run tests and enforce branch naming conventions

## Versioning

This project uses semantic versioning based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- **Patch Version (0.0.x)**: Automatically incremented for `fix:` commits
- **Minor Version (0.x.0)**: Automatically incremented for `feat:` commits
- **Major Version (x.0.0)**: Automatically incremented for commits with `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `feat!:`

The versioning system is managed by [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version), which:

1. Increments the version in package.json based on commit types
2. Generates/updates the CHANGELOG.md file
3. Creates a git tag for the new version

## Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

- **Lint**: Ensures code adheres to project standards
- **Type Check**: Verifies TypeScript type correctness
- **Test**: Runs the full test suite
- **Build**: Verifies the project builds successfully
- **Storybook**: Builds Storybook to ensure component documentation is valid
- **Security Scan**: Checks for high and critical security vulnerabilities in dependencies with allowlist support

CI runs on each push to main and on pull requests. Check the [.github/workflows](https://github.com/phrazzld/vanity/actions/workflows/ci.yml) directory for details.
