# CI/CD Infrastructure Improvements

## Current State Analysis

The project currently uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD with a single workflow file in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The workflow consists of two jobs:

1. **build-and-test**: This job runs on Ubuntu and performs the following steps:

   - Checkout code
   - Setup Node.js 20
   - Install dependencies with npm ci
   - Generate Prisma client
   - Check code formatting
   - Run ESLint
   - Run TypeScript type checking
   - Run tests with coverage
   - Upload coverage report as an artifact
   - Check Edge Runtime compatibility
   - Build Next.js application
   - Build Storybook

2. **security_scan**: This job runs after build-and-test and performs:
   - Checkout code
   - Setup Node.js
   - Install dependencies
   - Build security audit filter script
   - Run security scan with allowlist filtering

## Identified Opportunities for Improvement

Based on analysis of the codebase, TODO.md, and recent Git commits, the following opportunities for CI/CD improvements have been identified:

### 1. Performance Optimization

- **Caching Opportunities**:

  - The current workflow uses Node.js module caching but could benefit from caching the Next.js build output and Prisma client
  - Storybook build artifacts could be cached to speed up builds

- **Parallelization**:
  - Some steps could run in parallel, such as linting and type checking
  - Test execution could be parallelized by test suite or logical groupings

### 2. Security Enhancements

- **Pre-commit Security Scanning**:

  - Implement T020 from TODO.md: "Add security scan to pre-push hook"
  - Set up husky properly for pre-commit and pre-push hooks

- **Additional Security Tooling**:
  - Add static analysis security testing (SAST)
  - Implement dependency scanning beyond npm audit
  - Add secret scanning to prevent accidental secret leakage

### 3. Workflow Improvements

- **Branch-specific Optimizations**:

  - Implement different validation levels for feature branches vs. main
  - Skip certain steps on documentation-only changes

- **Build Matrix**:
  - Test on multiple Node.js versions (20 and LTS)
  - Test on multiple operating systems if relevant

### 4. Deployment Pipeline

- **Environment-specific Deployments**:

  - Add staging environment deployment workflow
  - Implement production deployment with proper approvals
  - Set up preview deployments for pull requests

- **Release Automation**:
  - Automate release notes generation
  - Integrate with existing standard-version setup

### 5. Developer Experience

- **Status Reporting**:

  - Improve error messages and failure reporting
  - Add GitHub status checks for specific stages
  - Integrate test results with GitHub UI

- **Documentation**:
  - Document CI/CD workflow for developers
  - Provide troubleshooting guides for common CI failures

## Specific Recommendations from TODO.md

Several items in TODO.md relate directly to CI/CD improvements:

1. **T020**: Add security scan to pre-push hook

   - Implement husky pre-push hook to run security scan
   - Ensure feedback is fast and clear for developers

2. **T021**: Verify CI pass/fail behavior

   - Create test cases demonstrating CI pass and fail scenarios
   - Document proper CI behavior with evidence

3. **T024-T027**: Technical debt items
   - Clean up redundant build steps
   - Remove temporary planning files
   - Streamline build verification

## Implementation Priorities

| Priority | Item                             | Effort | Value  | Risk   |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| HIGH     | Pre-push Security Hook           | Low    | High   | Low    |
| HIGH     | Workflow Parallelization         | Medium | High   | Low    |
| MEDIUM   | Build Caching Improvements       | Medium | High   | Medium |
| MEDIUM   | Environment-specific Deployments | High   | High   | Medium |
| MEDIUM   | Additional Security Tools        | High   | High   | Medium |
| LOW      | Multi-environment Testing        | Medium | Medium | Low    |
| LOW      | Release Automation               | Medium | Medium | Low    |

## Next Steps

1. Implement T020 to add security scanning to pre-push hook
2. Optimize CI workflow by parallelizing compatible steps
3. Implement caching for build artifacts to reduce execution time
4. Set up environment-specific deployment workflows
5. Add additional security scanning tools
6. Complete T021 to verify CI behavior
7. Document the CI/CD process for developers
