# T33: Add eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y

## Task

Install and configure eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y for catching accessibility issues.

## Implementation Summary

The task has been successfully completed with the following actions:

1. Installed eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y with --legacy-peer-deps to handle dependency conflicts:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. Updated eslint.config.cjs to:

   - Import the plugin: `const jsxA11y = require('eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y');`
   - Added a specific configuration block for React/JSX files
   - Configured rules with error/warning levels based on severity
   - Set stricter rules for critical accessibility concerns

3. Fixed critical accessibility issues in several components:

   - Removed redundant ARIA roles from list elements in QuotesList and ReadingsList
   - Added keyboard event handlers to interactive elements
   - Fixed invalid anchor links in ResponsiveExamples
   - Improved interactive element accessibility

4. Created comprehensive documentation in docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md with:
   - Explanation of accessibility importance
   - Details of configured rules
   - Common accessibility issues and solutions
   - Testing recommendations
   - Resources for further learning

## Technical Notes

- Used a combination of error and warning levels to prioritize the most critical accessibility issues
- Focused on key components that users interact with directly
- Provided proper keyboard navigation handlers for interactive elements
- Ensured semantic HTML usage with appropriate ARIA attributes

## Files Modified

- eslint.config.cjs - Added jsx-a11y plugin and configuration
- package.json/package-lock.json - Updated with new dependency
- src/app/components/quotes/QuotesList.tsx - Fixed accessibility issues
- src/app/components/readings/ReadingsList.tsx - Fixed accessibility issues

## Next Steps/Recommendations

1. Continue addressing remaining accessibility warnings
2. Consider implementing task T32 (axe-core for automated accessibility testing)
3. Consider implementing T34 (keyboard navigation utilities)
4. Run regular accessibility audits as new components are developed
