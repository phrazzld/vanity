## Technical Overview: `/Users/phaedrus/Development/vanity/public`

This directory serves as the root for publicly accessible assets within the `/Users/phaedrus/Development/vanity` application. It directly exposes content to web clients.

**Architecture:** The directory employs a relatively flat structure, containing image assets and a subdirectory named `images`.

**Key File Roles:**

*   **`globe.svg`**: An SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file, likely representing a globe or world icon.
*   **`next.svg`**: An SVG file, likely representing a "next" or "forward" navigation icon or logo.
*   **`vercel.svg`**: An SVG file, likely representing the Vercel logo.
*   **`window.svg`**: An SVG file, likely representing a window icon.
*   **`file.svg`**: An SVG file, likely representing a generic file icon.
*   **`images`**: A subdirectory containing image assets, as described in its separate overview.

**Dependencies:**

*   Proper web server configuration is essential to serve the files within this directory. The application's functionality relies on the web server correctly mapping URLs to these files.
*   The visual appearance of the application depends on the correct rendering of the SVG files by client browsers.

**Gotchas:**

*   The lack of a more structured organization beyond the `images` subdirectory could lead to management challenges as the number of assets grows.
*   The absence of a consistent naming convention for the SVG files may hinder maintainability and identification.
*   The root directory's content is directly exposed, so care should be taken to avoid placing sensitive or non-public files here.
