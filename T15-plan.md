# T15: Configure Theme Context in Storybook - Implementation Plan

## Task Analysis

This task requires configuring Storybook to properly support the application's ThemeProvider context. The goal is to ensure that all components rendered in Storybook have access to the theme context, which is essential for components that use theming features.

## Current State Assessment

I need to understand the current state of theme context integration in Storybook by:

1. Examining the existing ThemeDecorator.tsx file in the .storybook directory
2. Checking how the ThemeProvider is implemented in the application
3. Verifying how the ThemeDecorator is currently integrated in preview.ts
4. Testing how theme context dependent components currently behave in Storybook

## Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze Current Setup**:

   - Review existing `.storybook/ThemeDecorator.tsx`
   - Examine `src/app/context/ThemeContext.tsx` to understand the theme implementation
   - Check `.storybook/preview.ts` to see how decorators are currently applied

2. **Identify Requirements**:

   - Determine what aspects of ThemeProvider are needed by components
   - Check if any additional context or functionality is needed for proper component display

3. **Update or Create ThemeDecorator**:

   - If necessary, update the existing ThemeDecorator to ensure it:
     - Properly wraps components in the ThemeProvider
     - Handles theme switching/toggling
     - Integrates with storybook-dark-mode addon
   - If no ThemeDecorator exists, create one

4. **Configure in preview.ts**:

   - Ensure ThemeDecorator is correctly applied as a global decorator in the Storybook preview
   - Configure any necessary parameters for proper theme function

5. **Test Integration**:

   - Verify that components using theme context render correctly in Storybook
   - Test that dark mode toggle works with themed components
   - Test that ThemeProvider-dependent components receive proper context

6. **Document Changes**:
   - Update `.storybook/README.md` with information on theme context usage
   - Document how to work with themed components in Storybook

## Success Criteria

- Components that depend on theme context render correctly in Storybook
- Theme toggle functionality works properly within Storybook
- ThemeProvider's context is properly accessible to all components in stories
- All changes are properly documented in the README
