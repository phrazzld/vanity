# T041 Implementation Plan: Consider optimizing image import patterns for Next.js

## Task Overview

Evaluation task to analyze current image import patterns against Next.js best practices and provide recommendations for potential optimization.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Review T040 Investigation Findings

- Analyze completed investigation results from T040
- Extract current pattern strengths and limitations
- Identify specific areas for potential improvement

### 2. Research Next.js Best Practices

- Review official Next.js documentation for static asset handling
- Research Next.js Image component benefits and use cases
- Compare standard patterns vs current implementation
- Evaluate performance implications of different approaches

### 3. Evaluate Alternative Approaches

**Option A: Maintain Current Pattern**

- Keep `@/../public/images/projects/` pattern
- Document as project standard
- Address minor issues (unused files)

**Option B: Migrate to Next.js Image Component**

- Replace static imports with Next.js Image component
- Leverage automatic optimization features
- Consider responsive image loading

**Option C: Standardize Import Paths**

- Simplify to standard Next.js patterns
- Maintain static imports but improve path structure

### 4. Trade-off Analysis

- Complexity vs Benefits assessment
- Migration effort vs optimization gains
- Maintainability implications
- Performance impact analysis

### 5. Create Recommendations

- Document pros/cons of each approach
- Provide clear recommendation based on project needs
- Create implementation plan if changes beneficial

## Success Criteria

- Analysis complete on optimal image import strategy
- Recommendation documented with pros/cons
- Implementation plan created if changes are recommended

## Adherence to Development Philosophy

- **Simplicity First**: Favor simpler approaches unless clear benefits justify complexity
- **Maintainability**: Prioritize long-term code clarity and ease of modification
- **Explicit over Implicit**: Ensure any recommended patterns are clear and obvious
