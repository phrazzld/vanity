# Welcome to Vanity UI Components

This Storybook instance contains the documentation and interactive examples for all UI components used in the Vanity project.

## Component Organization

The components follow the Atomic Design methodology:

- **Atoms:** Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, typography)
- **Molecules:** Simple combinations of atoms
- **Organisms:** Complex UI sections
- **Templates:** Page-level layouts
- **Pages:** Actual implementations

## Using This Storybook

- Browse components via the sidebar navigation
- Each component has interactive examples where you can modify props
- Use the "Docs" tab to view full API documentation
- Toggle between light and dark mode using the toolbar at the top
- Test accessibility compliance using the Accessibility tab

## Component Development Workflow

1. Define component requirements, API, and design
2. Implement component with tests
3. Create Storybook stories with documentation
4. Review in isolation (UI, functionality, accessibility)
5. Integrate into the application

## Design System

The components use Tailwind CSS for styling with a consistent design system:

- Colors are defined in the Tailwind config
- Responsive breakpoints follow Tailwind's default: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), etc.
- Dark mode is fully supported using the 'class' strategy

## Accessibility

All components are built with accessibility in mind and tested against WCAG AA standards. Use the Accessibility tab to verify compliance.
