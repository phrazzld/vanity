## Development Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify a Task**: Pick an issue from the issue tracker or a task from the project board. If you want to work on something that's not listed, please create an issue first to discuss it.

2. **Setup Your Environment**: Ensure your local development environment is properly set up according to the [Development Setup Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md).

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch following our [branch naming conventions](#branch-naming-conventions).

4. **Implement Changes**: Make your changes, following our [quality expectations](#quality-expectations) and [development philosophy](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md).

5. **Test Your Changes**: Run tests to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run lint
   npm run typecheck
   ```

6. **Commit Your Changes**: Follow our [commit guidelines](#commit-guidelines).

7. **Create a Pull Request**: Submit a PR for review, following our [pull request process](#pull-request-process).

8. **Address Feedback**: Make any necessary changes based on code review feedback.

9. **Merge**: Once approved, your PR will be merged into the main branch.

### Local Development Workflow

1. **Run the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **View Logs** (if needed):

   ```bash
   npm run logs:watch
   ```

3. **Run Tests in Watch Mode** (for TDD):

   ```bash
   npm run test:watch
   ```

4. **Use Storybook** for component development:
   ```bash
   npm run storybook
   ```

## Branch Naming Conventions

Branches should follow a consistent naming pattern based on the type of change:

- **Feature Branches**: `feature/description-of-feature`

  - Example: `feature/dark-mode-toggle`

- **Bug Fix Branches**: `fix/description-of-bug`

  - Example: `fix/pagination-calculation`

- **Documentation Branches**: `docs/what-was-documented`

  - Example: `docs/api-endpoints`

- **Refactoring Branches**: `refactor/what-was-refactored`

  - Example: `refactor/auth-flow`

- **Testing Branches**: `test/what-was-tested`

  - Example: `test/keyboard-navigation`

- **Performance Branches**: `perf/what-was-optimized`

  - Example: `perf/image-loading`

- **Planning Branches**: `plan/what-was-planned`

  - Example: `plan/infrastructure-ci-cd`

- **Release Branches**: `release/vX.Y.Z`

  - Example: `release/v1.2.0`

- **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/description`
  - Example: `hotfix/critical-auth-bug`

**Guidelines**:

- Use lowercase with hyphens to separate words
- Be concise but descriptive
- Include issue number if applicable (e.g., `feature/user-profile-#123`)

## Pull Request Process

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch** to the repository:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin your-branch-name
   ```

2. **Create a new PR** via the GitHub web interface.

3. **Fill out the PR template** completely, including:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Link to related issue(s)
   - Screenshot/video for UI changes
   - Test plan or results
   - Checklist of completed items

### PR Requirements

- **Title**: Use the same format as [commit messages](#commit-guidelines)

  - Example: `feat(ui): add dark mode toggle to settings page`

- **Description**: Provide context, reasoning, and details about implementation choices.

- **Size**: Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized (ideally < 500 lines of code).

- **Tests**: Include appropriate tests for new functionality and bug fixes.

- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation for significant changes.

### Review Process

1. **CI Checks**: All automated checks must pass before review.

2. **Code Review**: At least one project maintainer will review your code.

3. **Feedback**: Address any feedback or questions raised during review.

4. **Approval**: Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR.

### Merging Guidelines

- PRs are merged using the "Squash and merge" strategy to maintain a clean commit history.
- The PR title and description will be used for the squashed commit message.
- Branch should be deleted after merging.

## Quality Expectations

### Code Style and Formatting

- Follow the **TypeScript** coding standards outlined in [DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_TYPESCRIPT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_TYPESCRIPT.md).
- Adhere to the **frontend** development guidelines in [DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_FRONTEND.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_FRONTEND.md).
- Run formatting before committing:
  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```
- Run linting to catch issues:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Required for utility functions and isolated logic.
- **Component Tests**: Required for all React components using React Testing Library.
- **Integration Tests**: Required for API routes and data flow.
- **Coverage**: Maintain or improve existing test coverage. New code should have â‰¥85% coverage.
- **Test Approach**: Focus on behavior, not implementation. Test from the user's perspective.
- **Approach**: Follow the testing strategy outlined in [DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md#testing-strategy).

### Documentation Requirements

- **Code Comments**: Explain _why_, not _how_. Use JSDoc for public APIs and complex functions.
- **README Updates**: Update README.md for significant feature additions or changes.
- **API Documentation**: Document new or changed API endpoints.
- **Component Documentation**: Create/update Storybook stories for UI components.

### Accessibility Standards

- All features must meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliance standards.
- Run accessibility checks on UI components:
  ```bash
  npm run test-storybook
  ```
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly.
- Follow guidelines in [ACCESSIBILITY.md](docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md).

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize component rendering using React best practices.
- Minimize bundle size by avoiding unnecessary dependencies.
- Use appropriate data fetching strategies (SSR, SSG, ISR, or client-side based on use case).
- Follow guidelines in responsive design documentation for mobile performance.

### Security Considerations

- Validate all user inputs thoroughly.
- Never expose sensitive information in client-side code.
- Follow secure coding practices outlined in [DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md#security-considerations).
- Handle authentication and authorization properly.

## Commit Guidelines

The project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. See [COMMIT_CONVENTION.md](COMMIT_CONVENTION.md) for detailed guidelines.

### Key Points

- **Format**: `<type>([scope]): <description>`

  - Example: `feat(api): add endpoint for user preferences`

- **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

- **Scope**: Component or area affected (e.g., `ui`, `api`, `auth`, `db`)

- **Subject**:

  - Use imperative, present tense (e.g., "add" not "added")
  - Don't capitalize first letter
  - No period at the end

- **Body**: Optional. Explain motivation for the change and contrasts with previous behavior.

- **Footer**: Optional. Reference issues and breaking changes.

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses Husky and commitlint to enforce commit message format. Commits that don't follow the convention will be rejected automatically.

## Release Process

### Version Numbering

The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) with automated version determination based on commit types:

- **Patch Version (0.0.x)**: Automatically incremented for `fix:` commits
- **Minor Version (0.x.0)**: Automatically incremented for `feat:` commits
- **Major Version (x.0.0)**: Automatically incremented for commits with `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `feat!:`

### Release Creation

Releases are created automatically using standard-version, which:

1. Bumps the version in package.json based on commit types
2. Generates/updates the CHANGELOG.md file
3. Creates a git tag for the new version

To create a release manually:

```bash
npm run release        # Automatic version determination
npm run release:patch  # Force patch release
npm run release:minor  # Force minor release
npm run release:major  # Force major release
```

To preview what the next version would look like without making changes:

```bash
npm run release:dry-run
```

### Deployment Process

Deployment to production occurs after a successful release through the CI/CD pipeline. The process includes:

1. Running the full test suite
2. Building the application
3. Deploying to the staging environment
4. Running smoke tests
5. Deploying to production

## Community Guidelines

All contributors are expected to adhere to the project's code of conduct, which promotes a respectful and inclusive environment.

### Communication Channels

- **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues for bug reports, feature requests, and discussions.
- **Pull Requests**: Use GitHub Pull Requests for code contributions and reviews.
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for general questions and ideas.

### Issue Reporting Guidelines

When creating an issue, please:

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
