## Development Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify a Task**: Pick an issue from the issue tracker or a task from the project board. If you want to work on something that's not listed, please create an issue first to discuss it.

2. **Setup Your Environment**: Ensure your local development environment is properly set up according to the [Development Setup Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md), including the [Git hooks setup](docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md#3-set-up-git-hooks).

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch following our [branch naming conventions](#branch-naming-conventions).

4. **Implement Changes**: Make your changes, following our [quality expectations](#quality-expectations) and [development philosophy](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md).

5. **Test Your Changes**: Run tests to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run lint
   npm run typecheck
   ```

6. **Commit Your Changes**: Follow our [commit guidelines](#commit-guidelines).

7. **Create a Pull Request**: Submit a PR for review, following our [pull request process](#pull-request-process).

8. **Address Feedback**: Make any necessary changes based on code review feedback.

9. **Merge**: Once approved, your PR will be merged into the main branch.

### Local Development Workflow

1. **Run the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **View Logs** (if needed):

   ```bash
   npm run logs:watch
   ```

3. **Run Tests in Watch Mode** (for TDD):

   ```bash
   npm run test:watch
   ```

4. **Use Storybook** for component development:
   ```bash
   npm run storybook
   ```

## Branch Naming Conventions

Branches should follow a consistent naming pattern based on the type of change:

- **Feature Branches**: `feature/description-of-feature`

  - Example: `feature/dark-mode-toggle`

- **Bug Fix Branches**: `fix/description-of-bug`

  - Example: `fix/pagination-calculation`

- **Documentation Branches**: `docs/what-was-documented`

  - Example: `docs/api-endpoints`

- **Refactoring Branches**: `refactor/what-was-refactored`

  - Example: `refactor/auth-flow`

- **Testing Branches**: `test/what-was-tested`

  - Example: `test/keyboard-navigation`

- **Performance Branches**: `perf/what-was-optimized`

  - Example: `perf/image-loading`

- **Planning Branches**: `plan/what-was-planned`

  - Example: `plan/infrastructure-ci-cd`

- **Release Branches**: `release/vX.Y.Z`

  - Example: `release/v1.2.0`

- **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/description`
  - Example: `hotfix/critical-auth-bug`

**Guidelines**:

- Use lowercase with hyphens to separate words
- Be concise but descriptive
- Include issue number if applicable (e.g., `feature/user-profile-#123`)

## Pull Request Process

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch** to the repository:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin your-branch-name
   ```

2. **Create a new PR** via the GitHub web interface.

3. **Fill out the PR template** completely, including:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Link to related issue(s)
   - Screenshot/video for UI changes
   - Test plan or results
   - Checklist of completed items

### PR Requirements

- **Title**: Use the same format as [commit messages](#commit-guidelines)

  - Example: `feat(ui): add dark mode toggle to settings page`

- **Description**: Provide context, reasoning, and details about implementation choices.

- **Size**: Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized (ideally < 500 lines of code).

- **Tests**: Include appropriate tests for new functionality and bug fixes.

- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation for significant changes.

### Review Process

1. **CI Checks**: All automated checks must pass before review.

2. **Code Review**: At least one project maintainer will review your code.

3. **Feedback**: Address any feedback or questions raised during review.

4. **Approval**: Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR.

### Merging Guidelines

- PRs are merged using the "Squash and merge" strategy to maintain a clean commit history.
- The PR title and description will be used for the squashed commit message.
- Branch should be deleted after merging.

## Quality Expectations

### Code Style and Formatting

- Follow the **TypeScript** coding standards outlined in [DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_TYPESCRIPT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_TYPESCRIPT.md).
- Adhere to the **frontend** development guidelines in [DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_FRONTEND.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_FRONTEND.md).
- Run formatting before committing:
  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```
- Run linting to catch issues:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Required for utility functions and isolated logic.
- **Component Tests**: Required for all React components using React Testing Library.
- **Integration Tests**: Required for API routes and data flow.
- **Coverage**: Maintain or improve existing test coverage. New code should have â‰¥85% coverage.
- **Test Approach**: Focus on behavior, not implementation. Test from the user's perspective.
- **Approach**: Follow the testing strategy outlined in [DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md#testing-strategy).

### Documentation Requirements

- **Code Comments**: Explain _why_, not _how_. Use JSDoc for public APIs and complex functions.
- **README Updates**: Update README.md for significant feature additions or changes.
- **API Documentation**: Document new or changed API endpoints.
- **Component Documentation**: Create/update Storybook stories for UI components.

### Accessibility Standards

- All features must meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliance standards.
- Run accessibility checks on UI components:
  ```bash
  npm run test-storybook
  ```
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly.
- Follow guidelines in [ACCESSIBILITY.md](docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md).

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize component rendering using React best practices.
- Minimize bundle size by avoiding unnecessary dependencies.
- Use appropriate data fetching strategies (SSR, SSG, ISR, or client-side based on use case).
- Follow guidelines in responsive design documentation for mobile performance.

### Security Considerations

- Validate all user inputs thoroughly.
- Never expose sensitive information in client-side code.
- Follow secure coding practices outlined in [DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md#security-considerations).
- Handle authentication and authorization properly.

## Commit Guidelines

The project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. See [COMMIT_CONVENTION.md](COMMIT_CONVENTION.md) for detailed guidelines.

### Key Points

- **Format**: `<type>([scope]): <description>`

  - Example: `feat(api): add endpoint for user preferences`

- **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

- **Scope**: Component or area affected (e.g., `ui`, `api`, `auth`, `db`)

- **Subject**:

  - Use imperative, present tense (e.g., "add" not "added")
  - Don't capitalize first letter
  - No period at the end

- **Body**: Optional. Explain motivation for the change and contrasts with previous behavior.

- **Footer**: Optional. Reference issues and breaking changes.

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses Husky and commitlint to enforce commit message format. Commits that don't follow the convention will be rejected automatically.

Our pre-commit hooks run the following checks:

1. **Code Formatting**: Prettier formats all staged files
2. **Code Linting**: ESLint checks for code quality issues
3. **Type Checking**: TypeScript checks for type errors
4. **Commit Message**: Validates against Conventional Commits format
5. **File Size**: Blocks commits with files over 5MB (use Git LFS instead)

#### The "No `--no-verify`" Policy

**IMPORTANT**: We have a strict policy against bypassing Git hooks. The use of `--no-verify` is strongly discouraged.

Git hooks are in place to maintain code quality and prevent issues from reaching the repository. They:

- Format code consistently
- Check for linting errors
- Run type checking
- Validate commit message format
- Run tests before pushing

**Why this policy exists:**

1. **Code Quality**: Hooks ensure all code meets our quality standards
2. **CI/CD Success**: Pre-commit checks prevent CI failures later
3. **Team Consistency**: Everyone follows the same standards
4. **Time Savings**: Catching issues locally is faster than fixing them after push

**Alternatives for special cases:**

If you encounter situations where hooks are failing:

1. **Fix the issues**: This is always the preferred approach
2. **Temporary staging**: If you need to save work-in-progress:
   ```bash
   # Create a WIP commit on a branch
   git add .
   git commit -m "WIP: description" # Fix issues before pushing
   ```
3. **Partial commits**: Commit only the files that pass checks:
   ```bash
   git add file1.ts file2.ts
   git commit -m "feat: add feature"
   ```

**When exceptions might be considered:**

- Emergency hotfixes where hooks are broken (extremely rare)
- CI/CD infrastructure issues (should be fixed ASAP)

In these rare cases, you must:

1. Get explicit approval from a project maintainer
2. Document why hooks were bypassed in the commit message
3. Create an issue to fix the underlying problem

Remember: Git hooks are here to help you. If they're consistently causing problems, please raise an issue so we can improve them.

## CI/CD and Deployment Strategy

### Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)

Our CI pipeline runs comprehensive quality checks on every PR:

1. **Node.js v20** - Standardized runtime version
2. **Quality Checks**:
   - Code formatting (Prettier)
   - Linting (ESLint)
   - Type checking (TypeScript)
   - Test suite with coverage (85% minimum, 90% for core)
   - Build verification (Next.js and Storybook)

#### CI Pipeline Stages

1. **Dependency Installation**: Uses `npm ci` for reproducible installs
2. **Prisma Client Generation**: Generates database client
3. **Code Formatting Check**: Validates consistent formatting
4. **Linting**: Checks code quality with ESLint
5. **Type Checking**: Ensures TypeScript types are correct
6. **Testing**: Runs full test suite with coverage requirements
7. **Build**: Builds Next.js application
8. **Storybook Build**: Builds component documentation

#### CI Failure Troubleshooting

**Formatting Failures**:

- Run `npm run format` locally
- Commit the formatted files
- Enable format-on-save in VS Code (see `.vscode/settings.json`)

**Linting Failures**:

- Run `npm run lint` to see errors
- Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix some issues
- Common issues:
  - Unused variables: prefix with '\_' or remove
  - Missing return types: add explicit TypeScript types
  - Import order: let ESLint auto-fix handle this

**Type Check Failures**:

- Run `npm run typecheck` locally
- Add missing type annotations
- Fix type mismatches
- Avoid using 'any' type
- Check `DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_TYPESCRIPT.md`

**Test Failures**:

- Run `npm test` locally
- Run specific test: `npm test -- path/to/test`
- Update snapshots if needed: `npm test -- -u`
- Coverage requirements:
  - Global: 85% minimum
  - Core logic (api/, lib/): 90% minimum

**Build Failures**:

- Run `npm run build` locally
- Check for TypeScript errors
- Verify all imports are correct
- Ensure environment variables are set
- Common issues:
  - Missing environment variables
  - Import errors in production-only code
  - TypeScript errors not caught in dev mode

**Storybook Build Failures**:

- Run `npm run storybook` locally
- Check for story syntax errors
- Verify all component imports
- Review `.storybook` configuration
- See `STORYBOOK_GUIDELINES.md` for help

### Deployment (Vercel)

Vercel handles production deployments with a focused build process:

1. **Node.js v20** - Matches CI environment
2. **Build Process**:
   - Installs dependencies (`npm ci`)
   - Generates Prisma client
   - Builds Next.js with memory optimization
   - Skips Storybook build for performance

**Note**: Quality checks are intentionally omitted from deployment builds as they're already enforced in CI. This separation ensures fast deployments while maintaining code quality through the PR process.

### Environment Alignment

- Node.js version: **v20** (specified in `.nvmrc`, `package.json`, and both CI/CD configs)
- Dependencies: Locked via `package-lock.json` and installed with `npm ci`
- Build commands: Optimized for each environment's purpose

### Automated Dependency Management

The project uses GitHub Dependabot to automatically manage dependencies:

- **NPM packages**: Scanned daily at 06:00 UTC
- **GitHub Actions**: Scanned weekly on Mondays
- **Pull Request Grouping**: Dependencies are grouped by type (production, development, types)
- **Commit Messages**: Uses semantic commit format (e.g., `chore(deps): update dependencies`)
- **PR Limits**: Maximum 5 open PRs for npm, 3 for GitHub Actions

Dependabot PRs are labeled with `dependencies` and `automated` for easy filtering.

## Release Process

### Version Numbering

The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) with automated version determination based on commit types:

- **Patch Version (0.0.x)**: Automatically incremented for `fix:` commits
- **Minor Version (0.x.0)**: Automatically incremented for `feat:` commits
- **Major Version (x.0.0)**: Automatically incremented for commits with `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `feat!:`

### Release Creation

Releases are created automatically using standard-version, which:

1. Bumps the version in package.json based on commit types
2. Generates/updates the CHANGELOG.md file
3. Creates a git tag for the new version

To create a release manually:

```bash
npm run release        # Automatic version determination
npm run release:patch  # Force patch release
npm run release:minor  # Force minor release
npm run release:major  # Force major release
```

To preview what the next version would look like without making changes:

```bash
npm run release:dry-run
```

### Deployment Process

Deployment to production occurs after a successful release through the CI/CD pipeline. The process includes:

1. Running the full test suite
2. Building the application
3. Deploying to the staging environment
4. Running smoke tests
5. Deploying to production
