## Title

Fix useListState React Testing Issues

## Original Ticket Text

- **Action:** Address "not wrapped in act(...)" warnings in useListState.test.tsx by properly wrapping state updates with act() and fixing async testing patterns.
- **Depends On:** None

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

For the task of fixing React Testing Library "not wrapped in act(...)" warnings in useListState.test.tsx in the Vanity project, please analyze the current test implementation and recommend an approach to resolve these issues.

1. Core problem understanding:

   - What are the specific act() warning patterns occurring in the useListState tests?
   - Why are these warnings occurring in this particular component?
   - How does the current implementation of useListState handle asynchronous state updates?

2. Implementation considerations:

   - What are the best practices for handling async state updates in React Testing Library?
   - Should we modify the test structure, the hook implementation, or both?
   - Are there specific patterns we should implement to properly test custom hooks with async behavior?

3. Testing approach:

   - What is the correct way to use act() and waitFor() in React Testing Library for testing hooks?
   - Should we create a custom test utility for testing this type of state management hook?
   - How can we ensure that our tests remain reliable without becoming brittle?

4. Implementation plan:
   - What specific changes need to be made to fix each of the act() warnings?
   - How can we refactor the tests to be more resilient to future changes?
   - Are there any additional tests we should add to ensure full coverage of the hook's behavior?

Please provide a comprehensive analysis that considers the project's testing philosophy, the current implementation of useListState, and best practices for testing asynchronous React hooks with React Testing Library.
