## Git Hooks

  - [ ] Configure linting and formatting checks
  - [ ] Add type checking
  - [ ] Prevent commit of sensitive data and large files
  - [ ] Enforce conventional commit format
- [ ] Configure post-commit hooks
  - [ ] Set up `glance ./` to run async
  - [ ] Generate documentation updates if needed
- [ ] Configure pre-push hooks
  - [ ] Run complete test suite
  - [ ] Enforce branch naming conventions

## Quality Standards

- [ ] Implement file length enforcement
  - [ ] Configure warning at 500 lines
  - [ ] Configure error at 1000 lines
- [x] Set up conventional commits
  - [x] Add commitlint configuration
  - [x] Document commit message standards
- [ ] Configure semantic versioning
  - [ ] Set up automated versioning based on commits
  - [ ] Configure CHANGELOG generation
