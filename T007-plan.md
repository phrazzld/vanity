# T007 · Documentation · P1: Create Security Vulnerability Management Guide - Implementation Plan

## Overview

The task requires creating a comprehensive security vulnerability management guide in `docs/SECURITY_VULNERABILITY_MANAGEMENT.md` that covers dependency scanning purpose, interpretation of audit results, remediation process, handling false positives/allowlisting, and local scan instructions.

## Current State

After examining the codebase, I found that the document already exists at the specified path and contains all the required sections:

- Purpose and overview of dependency scanning
- Explanation of vulnerability scanning (CI and local)
- How to interpret audit results
- Vulnerability allowlisting process and configuration
- Remediation workflow
- Developer responsibilities
- Best practices
- Additional resources

## Implementation Approach

Since the document is already complete and contains all the required sections (and more), the only action needed is to:

1. Verify the document covers all required content (✓ confirmed)
2. Mark the task as completed in the TODO.md file

## Verification

- The document exists and is comprehensive
- All required sections from the TODO task are included
- The content is clear and accurate
