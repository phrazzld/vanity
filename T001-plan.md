# T001 Plan: Add Security Scan Job to CI Workflow

## Understanding the Current Setup

1. First, examine the existing CI workflow file to understand:
   - Current job structure
   - Where dependencies are installed
   - How required checks are configured

## Implementation Plan

1. Add a new `security_scan` job to the GitHub workflow:

   - Should run after dependencies are installed
   - Must have appropriate job dependencies
   - Should use the same Node.js version as other jobs

2. Ensure the job is properly configured:

   - Checkout code
   - Setup Node.js
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure as a required check for PRs to main
   - Set up proper naming to make it easily identifiable

3. Validate the structure matches other jobs in the workflow for consistency

## Validation

1. Review the updated workflow file to ensure:
   - Job is added in the correct position in the workflow
   - Dependencies are properly set
   - Job is configured as a required check

## Note

This task only creates the job structure. The actual npm audit implementation will be done in task T002.
