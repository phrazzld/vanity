In November 1994, Lee Kuan Yew, who served as the first prime minister of Singapore, was caught in a debate with other members of parliament regarding his proposed increases to government salaries. Lee had instituted a system under which the compensation of the island nation's public officials was set based on comparable salaries in private sector professions, including banking and law. By 2007, for example, the average salary of the country's ministers would rise to $1.26 million per year. Lee's critics argued that increasing salaries would attract the wrong type of candidate, those motivated to pursue government work for personal gain as opposed to public service. At a parliamentary debate on the matter, Lee responded that politicians "are real men and women, just like you and me, with real families who have real aspirations in life." He continued: "So when we talk of all these high-falutin, noble, lofty causes, remember at the end of the day, very few people become priests."
