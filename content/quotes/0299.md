One of the most significant mistakes made by observers of the technology industry's rise is to assume that the software produced by such companies is the reason for their domination of the modern economy. It is rather a set of cultural biases and practices and norms that make possible the production of such software, and thus are the underlying causes of the industry's success.

The central insight of Silicon Valley was not merely to hire the best and brightest but to treat them as such, to allow them the flexibility and freedom and space to create. The most effective software companies are artist colonies, filled with temperamental and talented souls. And it is their unwillingness to conform, to submit to power, that is often their most valuable instinct.
