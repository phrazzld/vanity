How does he achieve this independence? He does it by means of a continuous activity. How does he become free? By means of continuous effort. The one thing life can never do is to stand still. Independence is not a static condition; it is a continuous conquest, and in order to reach not only freedom, but also strength, and the perfecting of one's powers, it is necessary to follow this path of unremitting toil.
The child's first instinct is to carry out his actions by himself, without anyone helping him, and his first conscious bid for independence is made when he defends himself against those who try to do the action for him. To succeed by himself he intensifies his efforts.
