If all that I have said of her below
were gathered now into a single paean
that would be scant praise of her beauty now.

The beauty I saw there transcends all measure
of mortal minds. I think only her Maker
can wholly comprehend so great a treasure.

Here I concede defeat. No poet known,
comic or tragic, challenged by his theme
to show his power, was ever more outdone.

As feeblest eyes, struck by the sun, go blind,
so the remembrance of my lady's smile
strikes every recognition from my mind.

From the first day I looked upon her face
in this life, to this present sight of her,
my song has followed her to sing her praise.

But here I must no longer even try
to walk behind her beauty. Every artist,
his utmost done, must put his brushes by.

So do I leave her to a clarion
of greater note than mine, which starts to draw
its long and arduous theme to a conclusion.
