What we suffer from today is humility in the wrong place. ... A man was meant to be doubtful about himself, but undoubting about the truth, this has been exactly reversed. ... The old humility was a spur that prevented a man from stopping; not a nail in his boot that prevented him from going on. For the old humility made a man doubtful about his efforts, which might make him work harder. But the new humility makes a man doubtful about his aims, which will make him stop working altogether.
