That is what mortals misunderstand. They say of some temporal suffering, "No future bliss can make up for it," not knowing that Heaven, once attained, will work backwards and turn even that agony into a glory. And of some sinful pleasure they say "Let me have but _this_ and I'll take the consequences": little dreaming how damnation will spread back and back into their past and contaminate the pleasure of the sin.
