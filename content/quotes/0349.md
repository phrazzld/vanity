... there is the myth which gives me the greatest pain, the myth that the purpose of life is happiness, and that you ought to have fun. Where was it written that life is so cheap? Where was it written that life is, or should be, or can ever be, free of conflict and effort and deprivation and sacrifice? ...
The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable. It is to be compassionate. It is to matter, to have it make some difference that you lived.
