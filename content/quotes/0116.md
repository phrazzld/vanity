Sapiens have become so high on the food chain that many eat thousands of animals without killing a single one. They have mastered predation and killing to a point where they have turned it into a subscription service. They outsource their predation services so effectively that they forget they're predators and they get upset––even horrified––when they're reminded about what they're paying for.
