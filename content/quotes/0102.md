The person who isn't subject to hindrance is free, he who has eveything at hand as he wants it; but one who is subject to hindrance, or constraint, or obstruction, or can be thrown into any difficulty against his will, is a slave. And who is the person who is free from all hindrance? He who desires nothing that is not his own. And what are the things that are not our own? Those that are not within our power, either to have or not to have, or to have with certain qualities, or under certain conditions. Our body is thus not our own, every part of it is not our own, and our property is not our own. So if you become attached to any of these as though it were your own, you'll suffer the punishment that a person deserves if he sets his aim on what is not his own. This is the road that leads to freedom, this is the only deliverance from slavery, to be able to say one day with your whole heart,

Guide me, Zeus, and thou, O Destiny,
To wheresoever you have assigned me.
