When leaving the office one day, Rockefeller fished in his pockets and realized that he had forgotten his change purse. When he asked to borrow a nickel from Rogers, his assistant volunteered to make a gift of it, but Rockefeller protested. "No, Rogers," he said, "don't forget this transaction. This is a whole year's interest on a dollar."
