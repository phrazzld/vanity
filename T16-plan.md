# T16: Configure Dark Mode Support in Storybook

## Task Description

Configure the `storybook-dark-mode` addon to integrate with Tailwind's dark mode.

## Implementation Plan

1. First, verify the current state of dark mode configuration in Storybook:

   - Check if the `storybook-dark-mode` addon is already installed and configured in `.storybook/main.ts`
   - Review the existing ThemeDecorator to understand how it's currently handling dark mode

2. Enhance the integration between Storybook's dark mode and Tailwind:

   - Ensure the Storybook dark mode addon is properly configured
   - Update the ThemeDecorator (if needed) to react to Storybook's dark mode changes
   - Ensure that the `dark` class is properly applied to the HTML document
   - Verify that Tailwind's dark mode classes work as expected

3. Add documentation about dark mode usage in Storybook:

   - Update the Storybook README.md with information about dark mode
   - Include examples of how to toggle dark mode in Storybook
   - Explain how to create stories that showcase both light and dark mode variants

4. Test the integration:

   - Verify that toggling dark mode in Storybook properly updates components using Tailwind dark classes
   - Ensure that components using the ThemeContext respond correctly to dark mode changes
   - Check that individual stories can be configured to force dark or light mode

5. Update the TODO.md to mark this task as complete
